\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Citations}

Note that citations 
(like \cite{Wenzel2019} or \cite{Goodwin2020})
can be generated using {\tt BibTeX} or by using the
{\tt thebibliography} environment. This makes sure that the
table of contents includes an entry for the bibliography.
Of course you may use any other method as well.

\section{Options}

There are various documentclass options, see the documentation.  Here we are
using an option ({\tt bsc} or {\tt minf}) to choose the degree type, plus:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt frontabs} (recommended) to put the abstract on the front page;
\item {\tt twoside} (recommended) to format for two-sided printing, with
  each chapter starting on a right-hand page;
\item {\tt singlespacing} (required) for single-spaced formating; and
\item {\tt parskip} (a matter of taste) which alters the paragraph formatting so that
paragraphs are separated by a vertical space, and there is no
indentation at the start of each paragraph.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Background}

Of course
you may want to use several chapters and much more text than here.
