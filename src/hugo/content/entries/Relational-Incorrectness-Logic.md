    "abstract": "\nRecently, authors have proposed under-approximate logics for reasoning\nabout programs. So far, all such logics have been confined to\nreasoning about individual program behaviours. Yet there exist many\nover-approximate relational logics for reasoning about pairs of\nprograms and relating their behaviours. We present the first\nunder-approximate relational logic, for the simple imperative language\nIMP. We prove our logic is both sound and complete. Additionally, we\nshow how reasoning in this logic can be decomposed into non-relational\nreasoning in an under-approximate Hoare logic, mirroring Beringerâ€™s\nresult for over-approximate relational logics. We illustrate the\napplication of our logic on some small examples in which we provably\ndemonstrate the presence of insecurity.",
