    "abstract": "This entry provides several monads intended for the development of stand-alone certifiers via code generation from Isabelle/HOL. More specifically, there are three flavors of error monads (the sum type, for the case where all monadic functions are total; an instance of the former, the so called check monad, yielding either success without any further information or an error message; as well as a variant of the sum type that accommodates partial functions by providing an explicit bottom element) and a parser monad built on top. All of this monads are heavily used in the IsaFoR/CeTA project which thus provides many examples of their usage.",
