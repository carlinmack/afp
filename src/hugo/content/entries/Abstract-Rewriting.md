    "abstract": "\nWe present an Isabelle formalization of abstract rewriting (see, e.g.,\nthe book by Baader and Nipkow). First, we define standard relations like\n<i>joinability</i>, <i>meetability</i>, <i>conversion</i>, etc. Then, we\nformalize important properties of abstract rewrite systems, e.g.,\nconfluence and strong normalization. Our main concern is on strong\nnormalization, since this formalization is the basis of <a\nhref=\"http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/software/ceta\">CeTA</a> (which is\nmainly about strong normalization of term rewrite systems). Hence lemmas\ninvolving strong normalization constitute by far the biggest part of this\ntheory. One of those is Newman's lemma.",
