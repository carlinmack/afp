    "abstract": "We formalise a large portion of CCS as described in Milner's book 'Communication and Concurrency' using the nominal datatype package in Isabelle. Our results include many of the standard theorems of bisimulation equivalence and congruence, for both weak and strong versions. One main goal of this formalisation is to keep the machine-checked proofs as close to their pen-and-paper counterpart as possible.\n<p>\nThis entry is described in detail in <a href=\"http://www.itu.dk/people/jebe/files/thesis.pdf\">Bengtson's thesis</a>.",
