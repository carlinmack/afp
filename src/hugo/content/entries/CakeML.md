This entry contains an unofficial version\nof the CakeML semantics that has been exported from the Lem\nspecifications to Isabelle. Additionally, there are some hand-written\ntheory files that adapt the exported code to Isabelle and port proofs\nfrom the HOL4 formalization, e.g. termination and equivalence proofs.",
