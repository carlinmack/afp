    "abstract": "\n<p>The Euler-MacLaurin formula relates the value of a\ndiscrete sum to that of the corresponding integral in terms of the\nderivatives at the borders of the summation and a remainder term.\nSince the remainder term is often very small as the summation bounds\ngrow, this can be used to compute asymptotic expansions for\nsums.</p>  <p>This entry contains a proof of this formula\nfor functions from the reals to an arbitrary Banach space. Two\nvariants of the formula are given: the standard textbook version and a\nvariant outlined in <em>Concrete Mathematics</em> that is\nmore useful for deriving asymptotic estimates.</p>  <p>As\nexample applications, we use that formula to derive the full\nasymptotic expansion of the harmonic numbers and the sum of inverse\nsquares.</p>",
