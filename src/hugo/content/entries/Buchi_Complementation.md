The verification is done in three steps: <ol>\n<li>Definition of odd rankings and proof that an automaton\nrejects a word iff there exists an odd ranking for it.</li>\n<li>Definition of the complement automaton and proof that it\naccepts exactly those words for which there is an odd\nranking.</li> <li>Verified implementation of the\ncomplement automaton using the Isabelle Collections\nFramework.</li> </ol>",
