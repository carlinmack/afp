    "abstract": "\nThis entry formalizes the connection between Gröbner bases and\nMacaulay matrices (sometimes also referred to as `generalized\nSylvester matrices'). In particular, it contains a method for\ncomputing Gröbner bases, which proceeds by first constructing some\nMacaulay matrix of the initial set of polynomials, then row-reducing\nthis matrix, and finally converting the result back into a set of\npolynomials. The output is shown to be a Gröbner basis if the Macaulay\nmatrix constructed in the first step is sufficiently large. In order\nto obtain concrete upper bounds on the size of the matrix (and hence\nturn the method into an effectively executable algorithm), Dubé's\ndegree bounds on Gröbner bases are utilized; consequently, they are\nalso part of the formalization.",
