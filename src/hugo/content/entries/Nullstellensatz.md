    "abstract": "\nThis entry formalizes Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, an important\ntheorem in algebraic geometry that can be viewed as the generalization\nof the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra to multivariate polynomials: If\na set of (multivariate) polynomials over an algebraically closed field\nhas no common zero, then the ideal it generates is the entire\npolynomial ring. The formalization proves several equivalent versions\nof this celebrated theorem: the weak Nullstellensatz, the strong\nNullstellensatz (connecting algebraic varieties and radical ideals),\nand the field-theoretic Nullstellensatz. The formalization follows\nChapter 4.1. of <a\nhref=\"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-35651-8\">Ideals,\nVarieties, and Algorithms</a> by Cox, Little and O'Shea.",
