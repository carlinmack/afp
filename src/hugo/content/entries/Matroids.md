    "abstract": "\n<p>This article defines the combinatorial structures known as\n<em>Independence Systems</em> and\n<em>Matroids</em> and provides basic concepts and theorems\nrelated to them. These structures play an important role in\ncombinatorial optimisation, e. g. greedy algorithms such as\nKruskal's algorithm. The development is based on Oxley's\n<a href=\"http://www.math.lsu.edu/~oxley/survey4.pdf\">`What\nis a Matroid?'</a>.</p>"
