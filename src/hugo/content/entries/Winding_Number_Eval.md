    "abstract": "\nIn complex analysis, the winding number measures the number of times a\npath (counterclockwise) winds around a point, while the Cauchy index\ncan approximate how the path winds. This entry provides a\nformalisation of the Cauchy index, which is then shown to be related\nto the winding number. In addition, this entry also offers a tactic\nthat enables users to evaluate the winding number by calculating\nCauchy indices."
