    "abstract": "\nWe present a lightweight framework for the automatic verified\n(functional or imperative) memoization of recursive functions. Our\ntool can turn a pure Isabelle/HOL function definition into a\nmonadified version in a state monad or the Imperative HOL heap monad,\nand prove a correspondence theorem. We provide a variety of memory\nimplementations for the two types of monads. A number of simple\ntechniques allow us to achieve bottom-up computation and\nspace-efficient memoization. The frameworkâ€™s utility is demonstrated\non a number of representative dynamic programming problems. A detailed\ndescription of our work can be found in the accompanying paper [2].",
