    "abstract": "\nThis entry provides all cardinality theorems of the Twelvefold Way.\nThe Twelvefold Way systematically classifies twelve related\ncombinatorial problems concerning two finite sets, which include\ncounting permutations, combinations, multisets, set partitions and\nnumber partitions. This development builds upon the existing formal\ndevelopments with cardinality theorems for those structures. It\nprovides twelve bijections from the various structures to different\nequivalence classes on finite functions, and hence, proves cardinality\nformulae for these equivalence classes on finite functions.",
