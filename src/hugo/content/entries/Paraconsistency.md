    "abstract": "\nParaconsistency is about handling inconsistency in a coherent way. In\nclassical and intuitionistic logic everything follows from an\ninconsistent theory. A paraconsistent logic avoids the explosion.\nQuite a few applications in computer science and engineering are\ndiscussed in the Intelligent Systems Reference Library Volume 110:\nTowards Paraconsistent Engineering (Springer 2016). We formalize a\nparaconsistent many-valued logic that we motivated and described in a\nspecial issue on logical approaches to paraconsistency (Journal of\nApplied Non-Classical Logics 2005). We limit ourselves to the\npropositional fragment of the higher-order logic. The logic is based\non so-called key equalities and has a countably infinite number of\ntruth values. We prove theorems in the logic using the definition of\nvalidity. We verify truth tables and also counterexamples for\nnon-theorems. We prove meta-theorems about the logic and finally we\ninvestigate a case study.",
