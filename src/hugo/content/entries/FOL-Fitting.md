    "abstract": "We present a formalization of parts of Melvin Fitting's book \"First-Order Logic and Automated Theorem Proving\". The formalization covers the syntax of first-order logic, its semantics, the model existence theorem, a natural deduction proof calculus together with a proof of correctness and completeness, as well as the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem.",
