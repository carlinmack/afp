The\nproof follows the standard approach of assuming that e is algebraic and\nthen using a specific integer polynomial to derive two inconsistent bounds,\nleading to a contradiction.</p> <p>This kind of approach can be found in\nmany different sources; this formalisation mostly follows a <a  href=\"http://planetmath.org/proofoflindemannweierstrasstheoremandthateandpiaretranscendental\">PlanetMath article</a> by Roger Lipsett.</p>"
