    "abstract": "\n<p>Minkowski's theorem relates a subset of\n&#8477;<sup>n</sup>, the Lebesgue measure, and the\ninteger lattice &#8484;<sup>n</sup>: It states that\nany convex subset of &#8477;<sup>n</sup> with volume\ngreater than 2<sup>n</sup> contains at least one lattice\npoint from &#8484;<sup>n</sup>\\{0}, i.&thinsp;e. a\nnon-zero point with integer coefficients.</p>  <p>A\nrelated theorem which directly implies this is Blichfeldt's\ntheorem, which states that any subset of\n&#8477;<sup>n</sup> with a volume greater than 1\ncontains two different points whose difference vector has integer\ncomponents.</p>  <p>The entry contains a proof of both\ntheorems.</p>",
