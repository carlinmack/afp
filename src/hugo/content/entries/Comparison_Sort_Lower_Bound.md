    "abstract": "\n<p>This article contains a formal proof of the well-known fact\nthat number of comparisons that a comparison-based sorting algorithm\nneeds to perform to sort a list of length <em>n</em> is at\nleast <em>log<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;(n!)</em>\nin the worst case, i.&thinsp;e.&nbsp;<em>Î©(n log\nn)</em>.</p>  <p>For this purpose, a shallow\nembedding for comparison-based sorting algorithms is defined: a\nsorting algorithm is a recursive datatype containing either a HOL\nfunction or a query of a comparison oracle with a continuation\ncontaining the remaining computation. This makes it possible to force\nthe algorithm to use only comparisons and to track the number of\ncomparisons made.</p>",
