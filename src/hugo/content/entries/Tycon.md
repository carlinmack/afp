This work is described\nin detail in the ICFP 2012 paper <i>Formal Verification of Monad\nTransformers</i> by the author. The formalization is a revised and\nupdated version of earlier joint work with Matthews and White.\n<P>\nBased on the hierarchy of type classes in Haskell, we define classes\nfor functors, monads, monad-plus, etc. Each one includes all the\nstandard laws as axioms. We also provide a new user command,\ntycondef, for defining new type constructors in HOLCF. Using tycondef,\nwe instantiate the type class hierarchy with various monads and monad\ntransformers.",
