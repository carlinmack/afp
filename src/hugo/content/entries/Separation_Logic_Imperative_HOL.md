    "abstract": "\nWe provide a framework for separation-logic based correctness proofs of\nImperative HOL programs. Our framework comes with a set of proof methods to\nautomate canonical tasks such as verification condition generation and\nframe inference. Moreover, we provide a set of examples that show the\napplicability of our framework. The examples include algorithms on lists,\nhash-tables, and union-find trees. We also provide abstract interfaces for\nlists, maps, and sets, that allow to develop generic imperative algorithms\nand use data-refinement techniques.\n<br>\nAs we target Imperative HOL, our programs can be translated to\nefficiently executable code in various target languages, including\nML, OCaml, Haskell, and Scala.",
