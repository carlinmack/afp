It\ncontains locale-based formalisations of selected parts of set, group\nand ring theory from Jacobson's <i>Basic Algebra</i>\nleading to the respective fundamental homomorphism theorems.  The\nstudy is not intended as a library base for abstract algebra.  It\nrather explores an approach towards abstract algebra in Isabelle."
