    "abstract": "\n<p>\nAn extension of classical noninterference security for deterministic\nstate machines, as introduced by Goguen and Meseguer and elegantly\nformalized by Rushby, to nondeterministic systems should satisfy two\nfundamental requirements: it should be based on a mathematically precise\ntheory of nondeterminism, and should be equivalent to (or at least not\nweaker than) the classical notion in the degenerate deterministic case.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis paper proposes a definition of noninterference security applying\nto Hoare's Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) in the general case of\na possibly intransitive noninterference policy, and proves the\nequivalence of this security property to classical noninterference\nsecurity for processes representing deterministic state machines.\n</p>\n<p>\nFurthermore, McCullough's generalized noninterference security is shown\nto be weaker than both the proposed notion of CSP noninterference security\nfor a generic process, and classical noninterference security for processes\nrepresenting deterministic state machines. This renders CSP noninterference\nsecurity preferable as an extension of classical noninterference security\nto nondeterministic systems.\n</p>",
