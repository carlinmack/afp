    "abstract": "\nWe formalize the basics of projective geometry. In particular, we give\na proof of the so-called Hessenberg's theorem in projective plane\ngeometry. We also provide a proof of the so-called Desargues's\ntheorem based on an axiomatization of (higher) projective space\ngeometry using the notion of rank of a matroid. This last approach\nallows to handle incidence relations in an homogeneous way dealing\nonly with points and without the need of talking explicitly about\nlines, planes or any higher entity.",
