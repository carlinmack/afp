    "abstract": "This article formalizes normalization by evaluation as implemented in Isabelle. Lambda calculus plus term rewriting is compiled into a functional program with pattern matching. It is proved that the result of a successful evaluation is a) correct, i.e. equivalent to the input, and b) in normal form.",
