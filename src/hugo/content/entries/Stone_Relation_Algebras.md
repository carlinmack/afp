    "abstract": "\nWe develop Stone relation algebras, which generalise relation algebras\nby replacing the underlying Boolean algebra structure with a Stone\nalgebra. We show that finite matrices over extended real numbers form\nan instance. As a consequence, relation-algebraic concepts and methods\ncan be used for reasoning about weighted graphs. We also develop a\nfixpoint calculus and apply it to compare different definitions of\nreflexive-transitive closures in semirings.",
