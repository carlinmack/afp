    "abstract": "\nA range of algebras between lattices and Boolean algebras generalise\nthe notion of a complement. We develop a hierarchy of these\npseudo-complemented algebras that includes Stone algebras.\nIndependently of this theory we study filters based on partial orders.\nBoth theories are combined to prove Chen and Gr√§tzer's construction\ntheorem for Stone algebras. The latter involves extensive reasoning\nabout algebraic structures in addition to reasoning in algebraic\nstructures."
