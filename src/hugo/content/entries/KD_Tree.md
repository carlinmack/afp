It includes a balanced build algorithm as\nwell as the nearest neighbor algorithm and the range search algorithm.\nIt is based on the papers <a\nhref=\"https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=361002.361007\">Multidimensional\nbinary search trees used for associative searching</a> and <a\nhref=\"https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=355744.355745\">\nAn Algorithm for Finding Best Matches in Logarithmic Expected\nTime</a>.",
