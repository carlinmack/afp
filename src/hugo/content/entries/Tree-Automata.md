    "abstract": "This work presents a machine-checked tree automata library for Standard-ML, OCaml and Haskell. The algorithms are efficient by using appropriate data structures like RB-trees. The available algorithms for non-deterministic automata include membership query, reduction, intersection, union, and emptiness check with computation of a witness for non-emptiness. The executable algorithms are derived from less-concrete, non-executable algorithms using data-refinement techniques. The concrete data structures are from the Isabelle Collections Framework. Moreover, this work contains a formalization of the class of tree-regular languages and its closure properties under set operations.",
