    "abstract": "\nPartial Semigroups are relevant to the foundations of quantum\nmechanics and combinatorics as well as to interval and separation\nlogics. Convolution algebras can be understood either as algebras of\ngeneralised binary modalities over ternary Kripke frames, in\nparticular over partial semigroups, or as algebras of quantale-valued\nfunctions which are equipped with a convolution-style operation of\nmultiplication that is parametrised by a ternary relation. Convolution\nalgebras provide algebraic semantics for various substructural logics,\nincluding categorial, relevance and linear logics, for separation\nlogic and for interval logics; they cover quantitative and qualitative\napplications. These mathematical components for partial semigroups and\nconvolution algebras provide uniform foundations from which models of\ncomputation based on relations, program traces or pomsets, and\nverification components for separation or interval temporal logics can\nbe built with little effort."
