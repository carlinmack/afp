    "abstract": "\n<p>pGCL is both a programming language and a specification language that\nincorporates both probabilistic and nondeterministic choice, in a unified\nmanner. Program verification is by refinement or annotation (or both), using\neither Hoare triples, or weakest-precondition entailment, in the style of\nGCL.</p>\n<p> This package provides both a shallow embedding of the language\nprimitives, and an annotation and refinement framework. The generated\ndocument includes a brief tutorial.</p>",
