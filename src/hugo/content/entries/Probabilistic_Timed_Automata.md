    "abstract": "\nWe present a formalization of probabilistic timed automata (PTA) for\nwhich we try to follow the formula MDP + TA = PTA as far as possible:\nour work starts from our existing formalizations of Markov decision\nprocesses (MDP) and timed automata (TA) and combines them modularly.\nWe prove the fundamental result for probabilistic timed automata: the\nregion construction that is known from timed automata carries over to\nthe probabilistic setting. In particular, this allows us to prove that\nminimum and maximum reachability probabilities can be computed via a\nreduction to MDP model checking, including the case where one wants to\ndisregard unrealizable behavior. Further information can be found in\nour ITP paper [2].",
