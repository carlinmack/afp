    "abstract": "This contribution contains a fast SAT solver for Isabelle written in Standard ML. By loading the theory <tt>DPT_SAT_Solver</tt>, the SAT solver installs itself (under the name ``dptsat'') and certain Isabelle tools like Refute will start using it automatically. This is a port of the DPT (Decision Procedure Toolkit) SAT Solver written in OCaml.",
