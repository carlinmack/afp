    "abstract": "\n<p> Linear recurrences with constant coefficients are an\ninteresting class of recurrence equations that can be solved\nexplicitly. The most famous example are certainly the Fibonacci\nnumbers with the equation <i>f</i>(<i>n</i>) =\n<i>f</i>(<i>n</i>-1) +\n<i>f</i>(<i>n</i> - 2) and the quite\nnon-obvious closed form\n(<i>&phi;</i><sup><i>n</i></sup>\n-\n(-<i>&phi;</i>)<sup>-<i>n</i></sup>)\n/ &radic;<span style=\"text-decoration:\noverline\">5</span> where &phi; is the golden ratio.\n</p> <p> In this work, I build on existing tools in\nIsabelle &ndash; such as formal power series and polynomial\nfactorisation algorithms &ndash; to develop a theory of these\nrecurrences and derive a fully executable solver for them that can be\nexported to programming languages like Haskell. </p>"
