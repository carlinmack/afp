    "abstract": "Tarski's algebra of binary relations is formalised along the lines of\nthe standard textbooks of Maddux and Schmidt and Str√∂hlein. This\nincludes relation-algebraic concepts such as subidentities, vectors and\na domain operation as well as various notions associated to functions.\nRelation algebras are also expanded by a reflexive transitive closure\noperation, and they are linked with Kleene algebras and models of binary\nrelations and Boolean matrices.",
