    "abstract": "We apply Andy Pitts's methods of defining relations over domains to\nseveral classical results in the literature. We show that the Y\ncombinator coincides with the domain-theoretic fixpoint operator,\nthat parallel-or and the Plotkin existential are not definable in\nPCF, that the continuation semantics for PCF coincides with the\ndirect semantics, and that our domain-theoretic semantics for PCF is\nadequate for reasoning about contextual equivalence in an\noperational semantics. Our version of PCF is untyped and has both\nstrict and non-strict function abstractions. The development is\ncarried out in HOLCF.",
