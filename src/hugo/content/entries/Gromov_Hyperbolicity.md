    "abstract": "\nA geodesic metric space is Gromov hyperbolic if all its geodesic\ntriangles are thin, i.e., every side is contained in a fixed\nthickening of the two other sides. While this definition looks\ninnocuous, it has proved extremely important and versatile in modern\ngeometry since its introduction by Gromov.  We formalize the basic\nclassical properties of Gromov hyperbolic spaces, notably the Morse\nlemma asserting that quasigeodesics are close to geodesics, the\ninvariance of hyperbolicity under quasi-isometries, we define and\nstudy the Gromov boundary and its associated distance, and prove that\na quasi-isometry between Gromov hyperbolic spaces extends to a\nhomeomorphism of the boundaries. We also prove a less classical\ntheorem, by Bonk and Schramm, asserting that a Gromov hyperbolic space\nembeds isometrically in a geodesic Gromov-hyperbolic space. As the\noriginal proof uses a transfinite sequence of Cauchy completions, this\nis an interesting formalization exercise.  Along the way, we introduce\nbasic material on isometries, quasi-isometries, Lipschitz maps,\ngeodesic spaces, the Hausdorff distance, the Cauchy completion of a\nmetric space, and the exponential on extended real numbers.",
