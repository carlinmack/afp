    "abstract": "\nWe formalize linear-time temporal logic (LTL) and the algorithm by Gerth\net al. to convert LTL formulas to generalized Büchi automata.\nWe also formalize some syntactic rewrite rules that can be applied to\noptimize the LTL formula before conversion.\nMoreover, we integrate the Stuttering Equivalence AFP-Entry by Stefan\nMerz, adapting the lemma that next-free LTL formula cannot distinguish\nbetween stuttering equivalent runs to our setting.\n<p>\nWe use the Isabelle Refinement and Collection framework, as well as the\nAutoref tool, to obtain a refined version of our algorithm, from which\nefficiently executable code can be extracted.",
