    "abstract": "\nIn the 18th century, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon posed and\nlater solved the following problem, which is often called the first\nproblem ever solved in geometric probability: Given a floor divided\ninto vertical strips of the same width, what is the probability that a\nneedle thrown onto the floor randomly will cross two strips?  This\nentry formally defines the problem in the case where the needle's\nposition is chosen uniformly at random in a single strip around the\norigin (which is equivalent to larger arrangements due to symmetry).\nIt then provides proofs of the simple solution in the case where the\nneedle's length is no greater than the width of the strips and\nthe more complicated solution in the opposite case.",
