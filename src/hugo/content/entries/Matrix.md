Moreover, it is proven that strongly normalizing\n(monotone) orders can be lifted to strongly normalizing (monotone) orders\nover matrices. We further show that the standard semirings over the\nnaturals, integers, and rationals, as well as the arctic semirings\nsatisfy the axioms that are required by our matrix theory. Our\nformalization is part of the <a\nhref=\"http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/software/ceta\">CeTA</a> system\nwhich contains several termination techniques. The provided theories have\nbeen essential to formalize matrix-interpretations and arctic\ninterpretations.",
