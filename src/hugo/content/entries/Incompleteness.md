This represents the first ever machine-assisted proof of the second incompleteness theorem. Compared with traditional formalisations using Peano arithmetic (see e.g. Boolos), coding is simpler, with no need to formalise the notion\nof multiplication (let alone that of a prime number)\nin the formalised calculus upon which the theorem is based.\nHowever, other technical problems had to be solved in order to complete the argument.",
