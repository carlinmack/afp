    "abstract": "\n<p>In this work, we define the Catalan numbers <em>C<sub>n</sub></em>\nand prove several equivalent definitions (including some closed-form\nformulae). We also show one of their applications (counting the number\nof binary trees of size <em>n</em>), prove the asymptotic growth\napproximation <em>C<sub>n</sub> &sim; 4<sup>n</sup> / (&radic;<span\nstyle=\"text-decoration: overline\">&pi;</span> &middot;\nn<sup>1.5</sup>)</em>, and provide reasonably efficient executable\ncode to compute them.</p>  <p>The derivation of the closed-form\nformulae uses algebraic manipulations of the ordinary generating\nfunction of the Catalan numbers, and the asymptotic approximation is\nthen done using generalised binomial coefficients and the Gamma\nfunction. Thanks to these highly non-elementary mathematical tools,\nthe proofs are very short and simple.</p>"
