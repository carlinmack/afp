    "abstract": "\nWe present a formally verified implementation of multivariate Taylor\nmodels. Taylor models are a form of rigorous polynomial approximation,\nconsisting of an approximation polynomial based on Taylor expansions,\ncombined with a rigorous bound on the approximation error. Taylor\nmodels were introduced as a tool to mitigate the dependency problem of\ninterval arithmetic. Our implementation automatically computes Taylor\nmodels for the class of elementary functions, expressed by composition\nof arithmetic operations and basic functions like exp, sin, or square\nroot.",
