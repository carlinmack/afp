    "abstract": "In his seminal paper \"Natural Semantics for Lazy Evaluation\", John Launchbury proves his semantics correct with respect to a denotational semantics, and outlines an adequacy proof. We have formalized both semantics and machine-checked the correctness proof, clarifying some details. Furthermore, we provide a new and more direct adequacy proof that does not require intermediate operational semantics.",
    "extra-history": "\nChange history:\n[2014-05-24]: Added the proof of adequacy, as well as simplified and improved the existing proofs. Adjusted abstract accordingly.\n[2015-03-16]: Booleans and if-then-else added to syntax and semantics, making this entry suitable to be used by the entry \"Call_Arity\".",
