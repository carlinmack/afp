    "abstract": "\nEconomic activity has always been a fundamental part of society. Due\nto modern day politics, economic theory has gained even more influence\non our lives. Thus we want models and theories to be as precise as\npossible. This can be achieved using certification with the help of\nformal proof technology. Hence we will use Isabelle/HOL to construct\ntwo economic models, that of the the pure exchange economy and a\nversion of the Arrow-Debreu Model. We will prove that the\n<i>First Theorem of Welfare Economics</i> holds within\nboth. The theorem is the mathematical formulation of Adam Smith's\nfamous <i>invisible hand</i> and states that a group of\nself-interested and rational actors will eventually achieve an\nefficient allocation of goods and services.",
