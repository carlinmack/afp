To\nthis end, we also developed algorithms to precisely compute roots of a\nrational number, and to perform a factorization of natural numbers which\neliminates duplicate prime factors.\n<p>\nOur results have been used to certify termination proofs which involve\npolynomial interpretations over the reals.",
