    "abstract": "\nWe apply data refinement to implement the real numbers, where we support all\nnumbers in the field extension Q[sqrt(b)], i.e., all numbers of the form p +\nq * sqrt(b) for rational numbers p and q and some fixed natural number b. To\nthis end, we also developed algorithms to precisely compute roots of a\nrational number, and to perform a factorization of natural numbers which\neliminates duplicate prime factors.\n<p>\nOur results have been used to certify termination proofs which involve\npolynomial interpretations over the reals.",
