    "abstract": "\nIn 1964, Fitch showed that the paradox of the surprise hanging can be\nresolved by showing that the judge’s verdict is inconsistent. His\nformalization builds on Gödel’s coding of provability.  In this\ntheory, we reproduce his proof in Isabelle, building on Paulson’s\nformalisation of Gödel’s incompleteness theorems.",
