    "abstract": "\nKleene algebras with domain are Kleene algebras endowed with an\noperation that maps each element of the algebra to its domain of\ndefinition (or its complement) in abstract fashion. They form a simple\nalgebraic basis for Hoare logics, dynamic logics or predicate\ntransformer semantics. We formalise a modular hierarchy of algebras\nwith domain and antidomain (domain complement) operations in\nIsabelle/HOL that ranges from domain and antidomain semigroups to\nmodal Kleene algebras and divergence Kleene algebras. We link these\nalgebras with models of binary relations and program traces. We\ninclude some examples from modal logics, termination and program\nanalysis.",
