    "abstract": "\nIn this submission array-based binary minimum heaps are formalized.\nThe correctness of the following heap operations is proved: insert,\nget-min, delete-min and make-heap. These are then used to verify an\nin-place heapsort. The formalization is based on IMP2, an imperative\nprogram verification framework implemented in Isabelle/HOL. The\nverified heap functions are iterative versions of the partly recursive\nfunctions found in \"Algorithms and Data Structures â€“ The Basic\nToolbox\" by K. Mehlhorn and P. Sanders and \"Introduction to\nAlgorithms\" by T. H. Cormen, C. E. Leiserson, R. L. Rivest and C.\nStein.",
