    "abstract": "\nWorst-case optimal multiway-join algorithms are recent seminal\nachievement of the database community. These algorithms compute the\nnatural join of multiple relational databases and improve in the worst\ncase over traditional query plan optimizations of nested binary joins.\nIn 2014, <a\nhref=\"https://doi.org/10.1145/2590989.2590991\">Ngo, RÃ©,\nand Rudra</a> gave a unified presentation of different multi-way\njoin algorithms. We formalized and proved correct their \"Generic\nJoin\" algorithm and extended it to support negative joins."
