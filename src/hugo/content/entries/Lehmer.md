    "abstract": "In 1927, Lehmer presented criterions for primality, based on the converse of Fermat's litte theorem. This work formalizes the second criterion from Lehmer's paper, a necessary and sufficient condition for primality.\n<p>\nAs a side product we formalize some properties of Euler's phi-function,\nthe notion of the order of an element of a group, and the cyclicity of the multiplicative group of a finite field.",
