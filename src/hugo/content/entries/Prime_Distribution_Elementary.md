The main topics that\nare addressed are properties of the distribution of prime numbers that\ncan be shown in an elementary way (i.&thinsp;e. without the Prime\nNumber Theorem), the various equivalent forms of the PNT (which imply\neach other in elementary ways), and consequences that follow from the\nPNT in elementary ways. The latter include, most notably, asymptotic\nbounds for the number of distinct prime factors of\n<em>n</em>, the divisor function\n<em>d(n)</em>, Euler's totient function\n<em>&phi;(n)</em>, and\nlcm(1,&hellip;,<em>n</em>).</p>",
