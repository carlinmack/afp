The subalgebras are\ndefined as the range of a complement-like operation on a semilattice.\nThis technique has been used, for example, with the antidomain\noperation, dynamic negation and Stone algebras. We present a common\nground for these constructions based on a new equational\naxiomatisation of Boolean algebras.",
