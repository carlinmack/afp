    "abstract": "\nThe Orbit-Stabiliser theorem is a basic result in the algebra of\ngroups that factors the order of a group into the sizes of its orbits\nand stabilisers.  We formalize the notion of a group action and the\nrelated concepts of orbits and stabilisers. This allows us to prove\nthe orbit-stabiliser theorem.  In the second part of this work, we\nformalize the tetrahedral group and use the orbit-stabiliser theorem\nto prove that there are twelve (orientation-preserving) rotations of\nthe tetrahedron."
