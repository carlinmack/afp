    "abstract": "\nThis entry provides a basic library for number partitions, defines the\ntwo-argument partition function through its recurrence relation and relates\nthis partition function to the cardinality of number partitions. The main\nproof shows that the recursively-defined partition function with arguments\nn and k equals the cardinality of number partitions of n with exactly k parts.\nThe combinatorial proof follows the proof sketch of Theorem 2.4.1 in\nMazur's textbook `Combinatorics: A Guided Tour`. This entry can serve as\nstarting point for various more intrinsic properties about number partitions,\nthe partition function and related recurrence relations.",
