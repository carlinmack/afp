    "abstract": "\nWe formalize a proof of Motzkin's transposition theorem and\nFarkas' lemma in Isabelle/HOL. Our proof is based on the\nformalization of the simplex algorithm which, given a set of linear\nconstraints, either returns a satisfying assignment to the problem or\ndetects unsatisfiability. By reusing facts about the simplex algorithm\nwe show that a set of linear constraints is unsatisfiable if and only\nif there is a linear combination of the constraints which evaluates to\na trivially unsatisfiable inequality.",
