They were invented by Sleator and Tarjan [SIAM 1986]\nand have logarithmic amortized complexity. This entry provides executable\nand verified functional skew heaps.\n<p>\nThe amortized complexity of skew heaps is analyzed in the AFP entry\n<a href=\"http://isa-afp.org/entries/Amortized_Complexity.html\">Amortized Complexity</a>.",
