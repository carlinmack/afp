    "abstract": "\nTaking as a starting point the author's previous work on\ndeveloping aspects of category theory in Isabelle/HOL, this article\ngives a compatible formalization of the notion of\n\"bicategory\" and develops a framework within which formal\nproofs of facts about bicategories can be given.  The framework\nincludes a number of basic results, including the Coherence Theorem,\nthe Strictness Theorem, pseudofunctors and biequivalence, and facts\nabout internal equivalences and adjunctions in a bicategory.  As a\ndriving application and demonstration of the utility of the framework,\nit is used to give a formal proof of a theorem, due to Carboni,\nKasangian, and Street, that characterizes up to biequivalence the\nbicategories of spans in a category with pullbacks.  The formalization\neffort necessitated the filling-in of many details that were not\nevident from the brief presentation in the original paper, as well as\nidentifying a few minor corrections along the way.",
