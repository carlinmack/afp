    "abstract": "\n<p>This entry provides three lemmas to count the number of multisets\nof a given size and finite carrier set. The first lemma provides a\ncardinality formula assuming that the multiset's elements are chosen\nfrom the given carrier set. The latter two lemmas provide formulas\nassuming that the multiset's elements also cover the given carrier\nset, i.e., each element of the carrier set occurs in the multiset at\nleast once.</p>  <p>The proof of the first lemma uses the argument of\nthe recurrence relation for counting multisets. The proof of the\nsecond lemma is straightforward, and the proof of the third lemma is\neasily obtained using the first cardinality lemma. A challenge for the\nformalization is the derivation of the required induction rule, which\nis a special combination of the induction rules for finite sets and\nnatural numbers. The induction rule is derived by defining a suitable\ninductive predicate and transforming the predicate's induction\nrule.</p>"
