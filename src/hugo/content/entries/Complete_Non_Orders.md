    "abstract": "\nWe develop an Isabelle/HOL library of order-theoretic concepts, such\nas various completeness conditions and fixed-point theorems. We keep\nour formalization as general as possible: we reprove several\nwell-known results about complete orders, often without any properties\nof ordering, thus complete non-orders. In particular, we generalize\nthe Knaster–Tarski theorem so that we ensure the existence of a\nquasi-fixed point of monotone maps over complete non-orders, and show\nthat the set of quasi-fixed points is complete under a mild\ncondition—attractivity—which is implied by either antisymmetry or\ntransitivity. This result generalizes and strengthens a result by\nStauti and Maaden. Finally, we recover Kleene’s fixed-point theorem\nfor omega-complete non-orders, again using attractivity to prove that\nKleene’s fixed points are least quasi-fixed points.",
