    "abstract": "\nThe propositions-as-types correspondence is ordinarily presented as\nlinking the metatheory of typed λ-calculi and the proof theory of\nintuitionistic logic. Griffin observed that this correspondence could\nbe extended to classical logic through the use of control operators.\nThis observation set off a flurry of further research, leading to the\ndevelopment of Parigots λμ-calculus. In this work, we formalise λμ-\ncalculus in Isabelle/HOL and prove several metatheoretical properties\nsuch as type preservation and progress."
