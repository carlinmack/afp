    "abstract": "\n<p>This article gives a formal version of Furstenberg's\ntopological proof of the infinitude of primes. He defines a topology\non the integers based on arithmetic progressions (or, equivalently,\nresidue classes). Using some fairly obvious properties of this\ntopology, the infinitude of primes is then easily obtained.</p>\n<p>Apart from this, this topology is also fairly ‘nice’ in\ngeneral: it is second countable, metrizable, and perfect. All of these\n(well-known) facts are formally proven, including an explicit metric\nfor the topology given by Zulfeqarr.</p>",
