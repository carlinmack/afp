    "abstract": "\n<p>\nLiouville numbers are a class of transcendental numbers that can be approximated\nparticularly well with rational numbers. Historically, they were the first\nnumbers whose transcendence was proven.\n</p><p>\nIn this entry, we define the concept of Liouville numbers as well as the\nstandard construction to obtain Liouville numbers (including Liouville's\nconstant) and we prove their most important properties: irrationality and\ntranscendence.\n</p><p>\nThe proof is very elementary and requires only standard arithmetic, the Mean\nValue Theorem for polynomials, and the boundedness of polynomials on compact\nintervals.\n</p>",
