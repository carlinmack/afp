    "abstract": "\nThis work presents a formalisation of a generating function proof for\nLucas's theorem. We first outline extensions to the existing\nFormal Power Series (FPS) library, including an equivalence relation\nfor coefficients modulo <em>n</em>, an alternate binomial theorem statement,\nand a formalised proof of the Freshman's dream (mod <em>p</em>) lemma.\nThe second part of the work presents the formal proof of Lucas's\nTheorem. Working backwards, the formalisation first proves a well\nknown corollary of the theorem which is easier to formalise, and then\napplies induction to prove the original theorem statement. The proof\nof the corollary aims to provide a good example of a formalised\ngenerating function equivalence proof using the FPS library. The final\ntheorem statement is intended to be integrated into the formalised\nproof of Hilbert's 10th Problem."
