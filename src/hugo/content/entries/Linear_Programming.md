    "abstract": "\nWe use the previous formalization of the general simplex algorithm to\nformulate an algorithm for solving linear programs. We encode the\nlinear programs using only linear constraints. Solving these\nconstraints also solves the original linear program. This algorithm is\nproven to be sound by applying the weak duality theorem which is also\npart of this formalization.",
