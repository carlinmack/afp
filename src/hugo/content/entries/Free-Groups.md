    "abstract": "\nFree Groups are, in a sense, the most generic kind of group. They\nare defined over a set of generators with no additional relations in between\nthem. They play an important role in the definition of group presentations\nand in other fields. This theory provides the definition of Free Group as\nthe set of fully canceled words in the generators. The universal property is\nproven, as well as some isomorphisms results about Free Groups.",
