    "abstract": "\nWe present a formalization of refinement calculus for reactive systems.\nRefinement calculus is based on monotonic predicate transformers\n(monotonic functions from sets of post-states to sets of pre-states),\nand it is a powerful formalism for reasoning about imperative programs.\nWe model reactive systems as monotonic property transformers\nthat transform sets of output infinite sequences into sets of input\ninfinite sequences. Within this semantics we can model\nrefinement of reactive systems, (unbounded) angelic and\ndemonic nondeterminism, sequential composition, and\nother semantic properties. We can model systems that may\nfail for some inputs, and we can model compatibility of systems.\nWe can specify systems that have liveness properties using\nlinear temporal logic, and we can refine system specifications\ninto systems based on symbolic transitions systems, suitable\nfor implementations.",
