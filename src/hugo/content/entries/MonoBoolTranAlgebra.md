    "abstract": "Algebras of imperative programming languages have been successful in reasoning about programs. In general an algebra of programs is an algebraic structure with programs as elements and with program compositions (sequential composition, choice, skip) as algebra operations. Various versions of these algebras were introduced to model partial correctness, total correctness, refinement, demonic choice, and other aspects. We formalize here an algebra which can be used to model total correctness, refinement, demonic and angelic choice. The basic model of this algebra are monotonic Boolean transformers (monotonic functions from a Boolean algebra to itself).",
