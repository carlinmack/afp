    "abstract": "Sturm's Theorem states that polynomial sequences with certain\nproperties, so-called Sturm sequences, can be used to count the number\nof real roots of a real polynomial. This work contains a proof of\nSturm's Theorem and code for constructing Sturm sequences efficiently.\nIt also provides the “sturm” proof method, which can decide certain\nstatements about the roots of real polynomials, such as “the polynomial\nP has exactly n roots in the interval I” or “P(x) > Q(x) for all x\n&#8712; &#8477;”.",
