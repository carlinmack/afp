    "abstract": "\n<p>Dealing with binders, renaming of bound variables, capture-avoiding\nsubstitution, etc., is very often a major problem in formal\nproofs, especially in proofs by structural and rule\ninduction. Nominal Isabelle is designed to make such proofs easy to\nformalise: it provides an infrastructure for declaring nominal\ndatatypes (that is alpha-equivalence classes) and for defining\nfunctions over them by structural recursion. It also provides\ninduction principles that have Barendregtâ€™s variable convention\nalready built in.\n</p><p>\nThis entry can be used as a more advanced replacement for\nHOL/Nominal in the Isabelle distribution.\n</p>",
