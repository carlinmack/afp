    "abstract": "\nThis document provides a concise overview on the core results of our\nprevious work on the exploration of axioms systems for category\ntheory. Extending the previous studies\n(http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01493) we include one further axiomatic\ntheory in our experiments. This additional theory has been suggested\nby Mac Lane in 1948. We show that the axioms proposed by Mac Lane are\nequivalent to the ones we studied before, which includes an axioms set\nsuggested by Scott in the 1970s and another axioms set proposed by\nFreyd and Scedrov in 1990, which we slightly modified to remedy a\nminor technical issue.",
