    "abstract": "\nThis formalisation contains the proof that there is no anonymous and\nneutral Social Decision Scheme for at least four voters and\nalternatives that fulfils both SD-Efficiency and SD-Strategy-\nProofness. The proof is a fully structured and quasi-human-redable\none. It was derived from the (unstructured) SMT proof of the case for\nexactly four voters and alternatives by Brandl et al.  Their proof\nrelies on an unverified translation of the original problem to SMT,\nand the proof that lifts the argument for exactly four voters and\nalternatives to the general case is also not machine-checked.  In this\nIsabelle proof, on the other hand, all of these steps are  fully\nproven and machine-checked. This is particularly important seeing as a\npreviously published informal proof of a weaker statement contained a\nmistake in precisely this lifting step.",
