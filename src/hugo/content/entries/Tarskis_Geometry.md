    "abstract": "\nTarski's axioms of plane geometry are formalized and, using the standard\nreal Cartesian model, shown to be consistent. A substantial theory of\nthe projective plane is developed. Building on this theory, the\nKlein-Beltrami model of the hyperbolic plane is defined and shown to\nsatisfy all of Tarski's axioms except his Euclidean axiom; thus Tarski's\nEuclidean axiom is shown to be independent of his other axioms of plane\ngeometry.\n<p>\nAn earlier version of this work was the subject of the author's\n<a href=\"http://researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz/handle/10063/2315\">MSc thesis</a>,\nwhich contains natural-language explanations of some of the\nmore interesting proofs.",
