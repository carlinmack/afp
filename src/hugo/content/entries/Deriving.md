    "abstract": "\n<p>We provide a framework for registering automatic methods\nto derive class instances of datatypes,\nas it is possible using Haskell's ``deriving Ord, Show, ...'' feature.</p>\n<p>We further implemented such automatic methods to derive comparators, linear orders, parametrizable equality functions,\nand hash-functions which are required in the\nIsabelle Collection Framework and the Container Framework.\nMoreover, for the tactic of Blanchette to show that a datatype is countable, we implemented a\nwrapper so that this tactic becomes accessible in our framework. All of the generators are based on\nthe infrastructure that is provided by the BNF-based datatype package.</p>\n<p>Our formalization was performed as part of the <a href=\"http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/software/ceta\">IsaFoR/CeTA</a> project.\nWith our new tactics we could remove\nseveral tedious proofs for (conditional) linear orders, and conditional equality operators\nwithin IsaFoR and the Container Framework.</p>",
