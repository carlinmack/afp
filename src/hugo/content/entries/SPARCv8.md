    "abstract": "\nWe formalise the SPARCv8 instruction set architecture (ISA) which is\nused in processors such as LEON3. Our formalisation can be specialised\nto any SPARCv8 CPU, here we use LEON3 as a running example. Our model\ncovers the operational semantics for all the instructions in the\ninteger unit of the SPARCv8 architecture and it supports Isabelle code\nexport, which effectively turns the Isabelle model into a SPARCv8 CPU\nsimulator. We prove the language-based non-interference property for\nthe LEON3 processor.  Our model is based on deterministic monad, which\nis a modified version of the non-deterministic monad from NICTA/l4v.",
