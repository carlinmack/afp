    "abstract": "This document contains formal correctness proofs of modern SAT solvers. Following (Krstic et al, 2007) and (Nieuwenhuis et al., 2006), solvers are described using state-transition systems. Several different SAT solver descriptions are given and their partial correctness and termination is proved. These include: <ul> <li> a solver based on classical DPLL procedure (using only a backtrack-search with unit propagation),</li> <li> a very general solver with backjumping and learning (similar to the description given in (Nieuwenhuis et al., 2006)), and</li> <li> a solver with a specific conflict analysis algorithm (similar to the description given in (Krstic et al., 2007)).</li> </ul> Within the SAT solver correctness proofs, a large number of lemmas about propositional logic and CNF formulae are proved. This theory is self-contained and could be used for further exploring of properties of CNF based SAT algorithms.",
