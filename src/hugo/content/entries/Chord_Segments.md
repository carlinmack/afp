    "abstract": "\nThis entry provides a geometric proof of the intersecting chords\ntheorem. The theorem states that when two chords intersect each other\ninside a circle, the products of their segments are equal.  After a\nshort review of existing proofs in the literature, I decided to use a\nproof approach that employs reasoning about lengths of line segments,\nthe orthogonality of two lines and the Pythagoras Law. Hence, one can\nunderstand the formalized proof easily with the knowledge of a few\ngeneral geometric facts that are commonly taught in high-school.  This\ntheorem is the 55th theorem of the Top 100 Theorems list."
