    "abstract": "\nWe provide a framework for registering automatic methods to derive\nclass instances of datatypes, as it is possible using Haskell's ``deriving Ord, Show, ...'' feature.\n<p>\nWe further implemented such automatic methods to derive (linear) orders or hash-functions which are\nrequired in the Isabelle Collection Framework. Moreover, for the tactic of Huffman and Krauss to show that a\ndatatype is countable, we implemented a wrapper so that this tactic becomes accessible in our framework.\n<p>\nOur formalization was performed as part of the <a href=\"http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/software/ceta\">IsaFoR/CeTA</a> project.\nWith our new tactic we could completely remove\ntedious proofs for linear orders of two datatypes.\n<p>\nThis development is aimed at datatypes generated by the \"old_datatype\"\ncommand.",
