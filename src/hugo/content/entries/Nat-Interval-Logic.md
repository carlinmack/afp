    "abstract": "We introduce a theory of temporal logic operators using sets of natural numbers as time domain, formalized in a shallow embedding manner. The theory comprises special natural intervals (theory IL_Interval: open and closed intervals, continuous and modulo intervals, interval traversing results), operators for shifting intervals to left/right on the number axis as well as expanding/contracting intervals by constant factors (theory IL_IntervalOperators.thy), and ultimately definitions and results for unary and binary temporal operators on arbitrary natural sets (theory IL_TemporalOperators).",
