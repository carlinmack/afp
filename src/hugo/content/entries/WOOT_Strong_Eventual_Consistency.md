    "abstract": "\nCommutative Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) are a promising new class of\ndata structures for large-scale shared mutable content in applications\nthat only require eventual consistency. The WithOut Operational\nTransforms (WOOT) framework is a CRDT for collaborative text editing\nintroduced by Oster et al. (CSCW 2006) for which the eventual\nconsistency property was verified only for a bounded model to date. We\ncontribute a formal proof for WOOTs strong eventual consistency."
