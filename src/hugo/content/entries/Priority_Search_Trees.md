    "abstract": "\nWe present a new, purely functional, simple and efficient data\nstructure combining a search tree and a priority queue, which we call\na <em>priority search tree</em>. The salient feature of priority search\ntrees is that they offer a decrease-key operation, something that is\nmissing from other simple, purely functional priority queue\nimplementations. Priority search trees can be implemented on top of\nany search tree. This entry does the implementation for red-black\ntrees.  This entry formalizes the first part of our ITP-2019 proof\npearl <em>Purely Functional, Simple and Efficient Priority\nSearch Trees and Applications to Prim and Dijkstra</em>.",
