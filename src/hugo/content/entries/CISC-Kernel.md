    "abstract": "\n<p>Intransitive noninterference has been a widely studied topic in the last\nfew decades. Several well-established methodologies apply interactive\ntheorem proving to formulate a noninterference theorem over abstract\nacademic models. In joint work with several industrial and academic partners\nthroughout Europe, we are helping in the certification process of PikeOS, an\nindustrial separation kernel developed at SYSGO. In this process,\nestablished theories could not be applied. We present a new generic model of\nseparation kernels and a new theory of intransitive noninterference. The\nmodel is rich in detail, making it suitable for formal verification of\nrealistic and industrial systems such as PikeOS. Using a refinement-based\ntheorem proving approach, we ensure that proofs remain manageable.</p>\n<p>\nThis document corresponds to the deliverable D31.1 of the EURO-MILS\nProject <a href=\"http://www.euromils.eu\">http://www.euromils.eu</a>.</p>",
