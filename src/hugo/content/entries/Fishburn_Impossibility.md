    "abstract": "\n<p>This formalisation contains the proof that there is no\nanonymous Social Choice Function for at least three agents and\nalternatives that fulfils both Pareto-Efficiency and\nFishburn-Strategyproofness. It was derived from a proof of <a\nhref=\"http://dss.in.tum.de/files/brandt-research/stratset.pdf\">Brandt\n<em>et al.</em></a>, which relies on an unverified\ntranslation of a fixed finite instance of the original problem to SAT.\nThis Isabelle proof contains a machine-checked version of both the\nstatement for exactly three agents and alternatives and the lifting to\nthe general case.</p>",
