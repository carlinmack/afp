    "abstract": "This is a formalization of Markov models in Isabelle/HOL. It\nbuilds on Isabelle's probability theory. The available models are\ncurrently Discrete-Time Markov Chains and a extensions of them with\nrewards.\n<p>\nAs application of these models we formalize probabilistic model\nchecking of pCTL formulas, analysis of IPv4 address allocation in\nZeroConf and an analysis of the anonymity of the Crowds protocol.\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.3870\">See here for the corresponding paper.</a>",
