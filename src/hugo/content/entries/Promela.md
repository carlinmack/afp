    "abstract": "\nWe present an executable formalization of the language Promela, the\ndescription language for models of the model checker SPIN. This\nformalization is part of the work for a completely verified model\nchecker (CAVA), but also serves as a useful (and executable!)\ndescription of the semantics of the language itself, something that is\ncurrently missing.\nThe formalization uses three steps: It takes an abstract syntax tree\ngenerated from an SML parser, removes syntactic sugar and enriches it\nwith type information. This further gets translated into a transition\nsystem, on which the semantic engine (read: successor function) operates.",
