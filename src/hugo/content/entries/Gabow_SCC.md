    "abstract": "\nWe present an Isabelle/HOL formalization of Gabow's algorithm for\nfinding the strongly connected components of a directed graph.\nUsing data refinement techniques, we extract efficient code that\nperforms comparable to a reference implementation in Java.\nOur style of formalization allows for re-using large parts of the proofs\nwhen defining variants of the algorithm. We demonstrate this by\nverifying an algorithm for the emptiness check of generalized BÃ¼chi\nautomata, re-using most of the existing proofs.",
