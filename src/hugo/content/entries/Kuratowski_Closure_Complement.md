    "abstract": "\nWe discuss a topological curiosity discovered by Kuratowski (1922):\nthe fact that the number of distinct operators on a topological space\ngenerated by compositions of closure and complement never exceeds 14,\nand is exactly 14 in the case of R. In addition, we prove a theorem\ndue to Chagrov (1982) that classifies topological spaces according to\nthe number of such operators they support.",
