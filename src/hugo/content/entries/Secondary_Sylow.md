    "abstract": "These theories extend the existing proof of the first Sylow theorem\n(written by Florian Kammueller and L. C. Paulson) by what are often\ncalled the second, third and fourth Sylow theorems. These theorems\nstate propositions about the number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group\nand the fact that they are conjugate to each other. The proofs make\nuse of an implementation of group actions and their properties.",
