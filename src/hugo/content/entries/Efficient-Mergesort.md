    "abstract": "We provide a formalization of the mergesort algorithm as used in GHC's Data.List module, proving correctness and stability. Furthermore, experimental data suggests that generated (Haskell-)code for this algorithm is much faster than for previous algorithms available in the Isabelle distribution.",
    "extra-history": "\nChange history:\n[2012-10-24]:\nAdded reference to journal article.<br>\n[2018-09-17]:\nAdded theory Efficient_Mergesort that works exclusively with the mutual\ninduction schemas generated by the function package.<br>\n[2018-09-19]:\nAdded theory Mergesort_Complexity that proves an upper bound on the number of\ncomparisons that are required by mergesort.<br>\n[2018-09-19]:\nTheory Efficient_Mergesort replaces theory Efficient_Sort but keeping the old\nname Efficient_Sort.",
