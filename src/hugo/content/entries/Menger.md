    "abstract": "\nWe present a formalization of Menger's Theorem for directed and\nundirected graphs in Isabelle/HOL.  This well-known result shows that\nif two non-adjacent distinct vertices u, v in a directed graph have no\nseparator smaller than n, then there exist n internally\nvertex-disjoint paths from u to v.  The version for undirected graphs\nfollows immediately because undirected graphs are a special case of\ndirected graphs."
