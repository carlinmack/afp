    "abstract": "\nThis is an Isabelle/HOL formalisation of graph saturation, closely\nfollowing a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jlamp.2018.06.005\">paper by the author</a> on graph saturation.\nNine out of ten lemmas of the original paper are proven in this\nformalisation. The formalisation additionally includes two theorems\nthat show the main premise of the paper: that consistency and\nentailment are decided through graph saturation. This formalisation\ndoes not give executable code, and it did not implement any of the\noptimisations suggested in the paper.",
