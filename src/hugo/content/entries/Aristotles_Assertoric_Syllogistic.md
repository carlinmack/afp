    "abstract": "\nWe formalise with Isabelle/HOL some basic elements of Aristotle's\nassertoric syllogistic following the <a\nhref=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-logic/\">article from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy by Robin Smith.</a> To\nthis end, we use a set theoretic formulation (covering both individual\nand general predication). In particular, we formalise the deductions\nin the Figures and after that we present Aristotle's\nmetatheoretical observation that all deductions in the Figures can in\nfact be reduced to either Barbara or Celarent. As the formal proofs\nprove to be straightforward, the interest of this entry lies in\nillustrating the functionality of Isabelle and high efficiency of\nSledgehammer for simple exercises in philosophy."
