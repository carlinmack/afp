    "abstract": "\nComputers may help us to understand --not just verify-- philosophical\narguments. By utilizing modern proof assistants in an iterative\ninterpretive process, we can reconstruct and assess an argument by\nfully formal means. Through the mechanization of a variant of St.\nAnselm's ontological argument by E. J. Lowe, which is a\nparadigmatic example of a natural-language argument with strong ties\nto metaphysics and religion, we offer an ideal showcase for our\ncomputer-assisted interpretive method."
