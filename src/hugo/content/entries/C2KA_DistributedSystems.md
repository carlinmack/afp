    "abstract": "\nCommunicating Concurrent Kleene Algebra (C²KA) is a mathematical\nframework for capturing the communicating and concurrent behaviour of\nagents in distributed systems. It extends Hoare et al.'s\nConcurrent Kleene Algebra (CKA) with communication actions through the\nnotions of stimuli and shared environments. C²KA has applications in\nstudying system-level properties of distributed systems such as\nsafety, security, and reliability. In this work, we formalize results\nabout C²KA and its application for distributed systems specification.\nWe first formalize the stimulus structure and behaviour structure\n(CKA). Next, we combine them to formalize C²KA and its properties.\nThen, we formalize notions and properties related to the topology of\ndistributed systems and the potential for communication via stimuli\nand via shared environments of agents, all within the algebraic\nsetting of C²KA.",
