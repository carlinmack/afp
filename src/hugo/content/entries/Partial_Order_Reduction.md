    "abstract": "\nThis entry provides a formalization of the abstract theory of ample\nset partial order reduction. The formalization includes transition\nsystems with actions, trace theory, as well as basics on finite,\ninfinite, and lazy sequences. We also provide a basic framework for\nstatic analysis on concurrent systems with respect to the ample set\ncondition."
