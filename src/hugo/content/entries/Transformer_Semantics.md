    "abstract": "\nThese mathematical components formalise predicate transformer\nsemantics for programs, yet currently only for partial correctness and\nin the absence of faults.  A first part for isotone (or monotone),\nSup-preserving and Inf-preserving transformers follows Back and von\nWright's approach, with additional emphasis on the quantalic\nstructure of algebras of transformers.  The second part develops\nSup-preserving and Inf-preserving predicate transformers from the\npowerset monad, via its Kleisli category and Eilenberg-Moore algebras,\nwith emphasis on adjunctions and dualities, as well as isomorphisms\nbetween relations, state transformers and predicate transformers."
