    "abstract": "\nThis is a complete formalization of the work of Hoare and Roscoe on\nthe denotational semantics of the Failure/Divergence Model of CSP. It\nfollows essentially the presentation of CSP in Roscoe’s Book ”Theory\nand Practice of Concurrency” [8] and the semantic details in a joint\nPaper of Roscoe and Brooks ”An improved failures model for\ncommunicating processes\".  The present work is based on a prior\nformalization attempt, called HOL-CSP 1.0, done in 1997 by H. Tej and\nB. Wolff with the Isabelle proof technology available at that time.\nThis work revealed minor, but omnipresent foundational errors in key\nconcepts like the process invariant. The present version HOL-CSP\nprofits from substantially improved libraries (notably HOLCF),\nimproved automated proof techniques, and structured proof techniques\nin Isar and is substantially shorter but more complete.",
