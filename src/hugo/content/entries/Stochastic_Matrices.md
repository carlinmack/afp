    "abstract": "\nStochastic matrices are a convenient way to model discrete-time and\nfinite state Markov chains. The Perron&ndash;Frobenius theorem\ntells us something about the existence and uniqueness of non-negative\neigenvectors of a stochastic matrix.  In this entry, we formalize\nstochastic matrices, link the formalization to the existing AFP-entry\non Markov chains, and apply the Perron&ndash;Frobenius theorem to\nprove that stationary distributions always exist, and they are unique\nif the stochastic matrix is irreducible."
