    "abstract": "\nWe bring the labelled sequent calculus $LS_{PASL}$ for propositional\nabstract separation logic to Isabelle. The tactics given here are\ndirectly applied on an extension of the Separation Algebra in the AFP.\nIn addition to the cancellative separation algebra, we further\nconsider some useful properties in the heap model of separation logic,\nsuch as indivisible unit, disjointness, and cross-split. The tactics\nare essentially a proof search procedure for the calculus $LS_{PASL}$.\nWe wrap the tactics in an Isabelle method called separata, and give a\nfew examples of separation logic formulae which are provable by\nseparata."
