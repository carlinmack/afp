    "abstract": "These therories describe Hoare logics for a number of imperative language constructs, from while-loops to mutually recursive procedures. Both partial and total correctness are treated. In particular a proof system for total correctness of recursive procedures in the presence of unbounded nondeterminism is presented.",
