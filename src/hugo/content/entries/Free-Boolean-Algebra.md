    "abstract": "This theory defines a type constructor representing the free Boolean algebra over a set of generators. Values of type (α)<i>formula</i> represent propositional formulas with uninterpreted variables from type α, ordered by implication. In addition to all the standard Boolean algebra operations, the library also provides a function for building homomorphisms to any other Boolean algebra type.",
