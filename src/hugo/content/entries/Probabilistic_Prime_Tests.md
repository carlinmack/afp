    "abstract": "\n<p>The most efficient known primality tests are\n<em>probabilistic</em> in the sense that they use\nrandomness and may, with some probability, mistakenly classify a\ncomposite number as prime &ndash; but never a prime number as\ncomposite. Examples of this are the Miller&ndash;Rabin test, the\nSolovay&ndash;Strassen test, and (in most cases) Fermat's\ntest.</p> <p>This entry defines these three tests and\nproves their correctness. It also develops some of the\nnumber-theoretic foundations, such as Carmichael numbers and the\nJacobi symbol with an efficient executable algorithm to compute\nit.</p>",
