    "abstract": "\nIsabelle includes various automatic tools for finding proofs under\ncertain conditions. However, for each conjecture, knowing which\nautomation to use, and how to tweak its parameters, is currently\nlabour intensive. We have developed a language, PSL, designed to\ncapture high level proof strategies. PSL offloads the construction of\nhuman-readable fast-to-replay proof scripts to automatic search,\nmaking use of search-time information about each conjecture. Our\npreliminary evaluations show that PSL reduces the labour cost of\ninteractive theorem proving. This submission contains the\nimplementation of PSL and an example theory file, Example.thy, showing\nhow to write poof strategies in PSL.",
