    "abstract": "\nThis entry shows that the falling factorial of a sum can be computed\nwith an expression using binomial coefficients and the falling\nfactorial of its summands. The entry provides three different proofs:\na combinatorial proof, an induction proof and an algebraic proof using\nthe Vandermonde identity.  The three formalizations try to follow\ntheir informal presentations from a Mathematics Stack Exchange page as\nclose as possible. The induction and algebraic formalization end up to\nbe very close to their informal presentation, whereas the\ncombinatorial proof first requires the introduction of list\ninterleavings, and significant more detail than its informal\npresentation."
