    "abstract": "\nThis theory is inspired by the HOL Light development of quaternions,\nbut follows its own route. Quaternions are developed coinductively, as\nin the existing formalisation of the complex numbers. Quaternions are\nquickly shown to belong to the type classes of real normed division\nalgebras and real inner product spaces. And therefore they inherit a\ngreat body of facts involving algebraic  laws, limits, continuity,\netc., which must be proved explicitly in the HOL Light version.  The\ndevelopment concludes with the geometric interpretation of the product\nof imaginary quaternions."
