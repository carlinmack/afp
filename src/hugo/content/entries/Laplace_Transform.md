    "abstract": "\nThis entry formalizes the Laplace transform and concrete Laplace\ntransforms for arithmetic functions, frequency shift, integration and\n(higher) differentiation in the time domain. It proves Lerch's\nlemma and uniqueness of the Laplace transform for continuous\nfunctions. In order to formalize the foundational assumptions, this\nentry contains a formalization of piecewise continuous functions and\nfunctions of exponential order."
