    "abstract": "Drawing on Sen's landmark work \"Collective Choice and Social Welfare\" (1970), this development proves Arrow's General Possibility Theorem, Sen's Liberal Paradox and May's Theorem in a general setting. The goal was to make precise the classical statements and proofs of these results, and to provide a foundation for more recent results such as the Gibbard-Satterthwaite and Duggan-Schwartz theorems.",
