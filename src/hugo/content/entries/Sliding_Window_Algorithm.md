    "abstract": "\nBasin et al.'s <a\nhref=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipl.2014.09.009\">sliding\nwindow algorithm (SWA)</a> is an algorithm for combining the\nelements of subsequences of a sequence with an associative operator.\nIt is greedy and minimizes the number of operator applications. We\nformalize the algorithm and verify its functional correctness. We\nextend the algorithm with additional operations and provide an\nalternative interface to the slide operation that does not require the\nentire input sequence."
