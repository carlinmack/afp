    "abstract": "The theory of groups, rings and modules is developed to a great depth. Group theory results include Zassenhaus's theorem and the Jordan-Hoelder theorem. The ring theory development includes ideals, quotient rings and the Chinese remainder theorem. The module development includes the Nakayama lemma, exact sequences and Tensor products.",
