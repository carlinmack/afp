    "abstract": "\n<p>We give a formal proof of the well-known results about the\nnumber of comparisons performed by two variants of QuickSort: first,\nthe expected number of comparisons of randomised QuickSort\n(i.&thinsp;e.&nbsp;QuickSort with random pivot choice) is\n<em>2&thinsp;(n+1)&thinsp;H<sub>n</sub> -\n4&thinsp;n</em>, which is asymptotically equivalent to\n<em>2&thinsp;n ln n</em>; second, the number of\ncomparisons performed by the classic non-randomised QuickSort has the\nsame distribution in the average case as the randomised one.</p>",
