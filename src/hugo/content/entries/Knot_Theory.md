    "abstract": "\nThis work contains a formalization of some topics in knot theory.\nThe concepts that were formalized include definitions of tangles, links,\nframed links and link/tangle equivalence. The formalization is based on a\nformulation of links in terms of tangles. We further construct and prove the\ninvariance of the Bracket polynomial. Bracket polynomial is an invariant of\nframed links closely linked to the Jones polynomial. This is perhaps the first\nattempt to formalize any aspect of knot theory in an interactive proof assistant.",
