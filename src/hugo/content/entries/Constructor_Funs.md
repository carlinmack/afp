    "abstract": "\nIsabelle's code generator performs various adaptations for target\nlanguages. Among others, constructor applications have to be fully\nsaturated. That means that for constructor calls occuring as arguments\nto higher-order functions, synthetic lambdas have to be inserted. This\nentry provides tooling to avoid this construction altogether by\nintroducing constructor functions."
