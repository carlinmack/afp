    "abstract": "\nOur theories formalise various matrix properties that serve to\nestablish existence, uniqueness and characterisation of the solution\nto affine systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In\nparticular, we formalise the operator and maximum norm of matrices.\nThen we use them to prove that square matrices form a Banach space,\nand in this setting, we show an instance of Picard-Lindelöf’s\ntheorem for affine systems of ODEs. Finally, we use this formalisation\nto verify three simple hybrid programs."
