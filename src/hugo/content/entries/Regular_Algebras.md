    "abstract": "\nRegular algebras axiomatise the equational theory of regular expressions as induced by\nregular language identity. We use Isabelle/HOL for a detailed systematic study of regular\nalgebras given by Boffa, Conway, Kozen and Salomaa. We investigate the relationships between\nthese classes, formalise a soundness proof for the smallest class (Salomaa's) and obtain\ncompleteness of the largest one (Boffa's) relative to a deep result by Krob. In addition\nwe provide a large collection of regular identities in the general setting of Boffa's axiom.\nOur regular algebra hierarchy is orthogonal to the Kleene algebra hierarchy in the Archive\nof Formal Proofs; we have not aimed at an integration for pragmatic reasons.",
