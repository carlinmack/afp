    "abstract": "\nWe give a simple relation-algebraic semantics of read and write\noperations on associative arrays. The array operations seamlessly\nintegrate with assignments in the Hoare-logic library. Using relation\nalgebras and Kleene algebras we verify the correctness of an\narray-based implementation of disjoint-set forests with a naive union\noperation and a find operation with path compression."
