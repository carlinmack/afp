    "abstract": "\nIn his dissertation, Olin Shivers introduces a concept of control flow graphs\nfor functional languages, provides an algorithm to statically derive a safe\napproximation of the control flow graph and proves this algorithm correct. In\nthis research project, Shivers' algorithms and proofs are formalized\nin the HOLCF extension of HOL.",
