    "abstract": "This article provides a formalisation of Beukers's straightforward analytic proof that ζ(3) is irrational. This was first proven by Apéry (which is why this result is also often called ‘Apéry's Theorem’) using a more algebraic approach. This formalisation follows [Filaseta's presentation](http://people.math.sc.edu/filaseta/gradcourses/Math785/Math785Notes4.pdf) of Beukers's proof.",
