    "abstract": "This formulation of the Roy-Floyd-Warshall algorithm for the\ntransitive closure bypasses matrices and arrays, but uses a more direct\nmathematical model with adjacency functions for immediate predecessors and\nsuccessors. This can be implemented efficiently in functional programming\nlanguages and is particularly adequate for sparse relations.",
