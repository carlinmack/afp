    "abstract": "\nWe formalise a statement of Green’s theorem—the first formalisation to\nour knowledge—in Isabelle/HOL. The theorem statement that we formalise\nis enough for most applications, especially in physics and\nengineering. Our formalisation is made possible by a novel proof that\navoids the ubiquitous line integral cancellation argument. This\neliminates the need to formalise orientations and region boundaries\nexplicitly with respect to the outwards-pointing normal vector.\nInstead we appeal to a homological argument about equivalences between\npaths.",
