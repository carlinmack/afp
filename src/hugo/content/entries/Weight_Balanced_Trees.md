    "abstract": "\nThis theory provides a verified implementation of weight-balanced\ntrees following the work of <a\nhref=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0956796811000104\">Hirai\nand Yamamoto</a> who proved that all parameters in a certain\nrange are valid, i.e. guarantee that insertion and deletion preserve\nweight-balance. Instead of a general theorem we provide parameterized\nproofs of preservation of the invariant that work for many (all?)\nvalid parameters.",
