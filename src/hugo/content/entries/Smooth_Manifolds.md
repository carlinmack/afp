    "abstract": "\nWe formalize the definition and basic properties of smooth manifolds\nin Isabelle/HOL. Concepts covered include partition of unity, tangent\nand cotangent spaces, and the fundamental theorem of path integrals.\nWe also examine some concrete manifolds such as spheres and projective\nspaces. The formalization makes extensive use of the analysis and\nlinear algebra libraries in Isabelle/HOL, in particular its\n“types-to-sets” mechanism."
