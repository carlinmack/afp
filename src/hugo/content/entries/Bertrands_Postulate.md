    "abstract": "\n<p>Bertrand's postulate is an early result on the\ndistribution of prime numbers: For every positive integer n, there\nexists a prime number that lies strictly between n and 2n.\nThe proof is ported from John Harrison's formalisation\nin HOL Light. It proceeds by first showing that the property is true\nfor all n greater than or equal to 600 and then showing that it also\nholds for all n below 600 by case distinction. </p>"
