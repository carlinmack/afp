    "abstract": "\nWe develop Stone-Kleene relation algebras, which expand Stone relation\nalgebras with a Kleene star operation to describe reachability in\nweighted graphs. Many properties of the Kleene star arise as a special\ncase of a more general theory of iteration based on Conway semirings\nextended by simulation axioms. This includes several theorems\nrepresenting complex program transformations. We formally prove the\ncorrectness of Conway's automata-based construction of the Kleene\nstar of a matrix. We prove numerous results useful for reasoning about\nweighted graphs.",
