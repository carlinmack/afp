    "abstract": "\nAllen’s interval calculus is a qualitative temporal representation of\ntime events. Allen introduced 13 binary relations that describe all\nthe possible arrangements between two events, i.e. intervals with\nnon-zero finite length. The compositions are pertinent to\nreasoning about knowledge of time. In particular, a consistency\nproblem of relation constraints is commonly solved with a guideline\nfrom these compositions. We formalize the relations together with an\naxiomatic system. We proof the validity of the 169 compositions of\nthese relations. We also define nests as the sets of intervals that\nshare a meeting point. We prove that nests give the ordering\nproperties of points without introducing a new datatype for points.\n[1] J.F. Allen.
