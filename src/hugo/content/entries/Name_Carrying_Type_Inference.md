    "abstract": "\nI formalise a Church-style simply-typed\n\\(\\lambda\\)-calculus, extended with pairs, a unit value, and\nprojection functions, and show some metatheory of the calculus, such\nas the subject reduction property. Particular attention is paid to the\ntreatment of names in the calculus. A nominal style of binding is\nused, but I use a manual approach over Nominal Isabelle in order to\nextract an executable type inference algorithm. More information can\nbe found in my <a\nhref=\"http://www.openthesis.org/documents/Verified-Metatheory-Type-Inference-Simply-603182.html\">undergraduate\ndissertation</a>."
