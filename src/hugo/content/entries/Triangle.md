    "abstract": "\n<p>\nThis entry contains a definition of angles between vectors and between three\npoints. Building on this, we prove basic geometric properties of triangles, such\nas the Isosceles Triangle Theorem, the Law of Sines and the Law of Cosines, that\nthe sum of the angles of a triangle is Ï€, and the congruence theorems for\ntriangles.\n</p><p>\nThe definitions and proofs were developed following those by John Harrison in\nHOL Light. However, due to Isabelle's type class system, all definitions and\ntheorems in the Isabelle formalisation hold for all real inner product spaces.\n</p>",
