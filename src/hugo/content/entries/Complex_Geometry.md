    "abstract": "\nA formalization of geometry of complex numbers is presented.\nFundamental objects that are investigated are the complex plane\nextended by a single infinite point, its objects (points, lines and\ncircles), and groups of transformations that act on them (e.g.,\ninversions and Möbius transformations). Most objects are defined\nalgebraically, but correspondence with classical geometric definitions\nis shown.",
