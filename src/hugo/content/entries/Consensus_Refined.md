    "abstract": "\nAlgorithms for solving the consensus problem are fundamental to\ndistributed computing. Despite their brevity, their\nability to operate in concurrent, asynchronous and failure-prone\nenvironments comes at the cost of complex and subtle\nbehaviors. Accordingly, understanding how they work and proving\ntheir correctness is a non-trivial endeavor where abstraction\nis immensely helpful.\nMoreover, research on consensus has yielded a large number of\nalgorithms, many of which appear to share common algorithmic\nideas. A natural question is whether and how these similarities can\nbe distilled and described in a precise, unified way.\nIn this work, we combine stepwise refinement and\nlockstep models to provide an abstract and unified\nview of a sizeable family of consensus algorithms. Our models\nprovide insights into the design choices underlying the different\nalgorithms, and classify them based on those choices.",
