    "abstract": "\nWe present a semantic embedding of a spatio-temporal multi-modal\nlogic, specifically defined to reason about motorway traffic, into\nIsabelle/HOL. The semantic model is an abstraction of a motorway,\nemphasising local spatial properties, and parameterised by the types\nof sensors deployed in the vehicles. We use the logic to define\ncontroller constraints to ensure safety, i.e., the absence of\ncollisions on the motorway. After proving safety with a restrictive\ndefinition of sensors, we relax these assumptions and show how to\namend the controller constraints to still guarantee safety.",
