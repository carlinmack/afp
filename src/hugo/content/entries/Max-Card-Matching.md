    "abstract": "\n<p>\nA <em>matching</em> in a graph <i>G</i> is a subset <i>M</i> of the\nedges of <i>G</i> such that no two share an endpoint. A matching has maximum\ncardinality if its cardinality is at least as large as that of any other\nmatching. An <em>odd-set cover</em> <i>OSC</i> of a graph <i>G</i> is a\nlabeling of the nodes of <i>G</i> with integers such that every edge of\n<i>G</i> is either incident to a node labeled 1 or connects two nodes\nlabeled with the same number <i>i &ge; 2</i>.\n</p><p>\nThis article proves Edmonds theorem:<br>\nLet <i>M</i> be a matching in a graph <i>G</i> and let <i>OSC</i> be an\nodd-set cover of <i>G</i>.\nFor any <i>i &ge; 0</i>, let <var>n(i)</var> be the number of nodes\nlabeled <i>i</i>. If <i>|M| = n(1) +\n&sum;<sub>i &ge; 2</sub>(n(i) div 2)</i>,\nthen <i>M</i> is a maximum cardinality matching.\n</p>",
