The following gives an example of the preferred way for citing entries in the AFP:

M. Jaskelioff and S. Merz, Proving the Correctness of Disk Paxos. _Archive of Formal Proofs_, June 2005, [http://isa-afp.org/entries/DiskPaxos.html](http://isa-afp.org/entries/DiskPaxos.html), Formal proof development.

The bibtext entry for this would be:

@article{Jaskelioff-Merz-AFP05,
  author =   {Mauro Jaskelioff and Stephan Merz},
  title =    {Proving the Correctness of Disk Paxos},
  journal =  {Archive of Formal Proofs},
  month =    Jun,
  year =     2005,
  note =     {\\url{http://isa-afp.org/entries/DiskPaxos.html}, Formal proof development},
  ISSN =     {2150-914x}
}
