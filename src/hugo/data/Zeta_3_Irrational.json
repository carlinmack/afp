    "Abstract": "This article provides a formalisation of Beukers's straightforward analytic proof that ζ(3) is irrational. This was first proven by Apéry (which is why this result is also often called ‘Apéry's Theorem’) using a more algebraic approach. This formalisation follows Filaseta's presentation of Beukers's proof.",
