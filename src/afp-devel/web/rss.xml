We formalize a notion of logic whose terms and formulas are kept
abstract. In particular, logical connectives, substitution, free
variables, and provability are not defined, but characterized by their
general properties as locale assumptions. Based on this abstract
characterization, we develop further reusable reasoning
infrastructure. For example, we define parallel substitution (along
with proving its characterizing theorems) from single-point
substitution. Similarly, we develop a natural deduction style proof
system starting from the abstract Hilbert-style one. These one-time
efforts benefit different concrete logics satisfying our locales&#39;
assumptions.  We instantiate the syntax-independent logic
infrastructure to Robinson arithmetic (also known as Q) in the AFP
entry &lt;a
href=&#34;https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Robinson_Arithmetic.html&#34;&gt;Robinson_Arithmetic&lt;/a&gt;
and to hereditarily finite set theory in the AFP entries &lt;a

and &lt;a

We present an abstract formalization of G&amp;ouml;del&#39;s
incompleteness theorems. We analyze sufficient conditions for the
theorems&#39; applicability to a partially specified logic. Our
abstract perspective enables a comparison between alternative
approaches from the literature. These include Rosser&#39;s variation
of the first theorem, Jeroslow&#39;s variation of the second theorem,
and the Swierczkowski&amp;ndash;Paulson semantics-based approach. This
AFP entry is the main entry point to the results described in our
CADE-27 paper &lt;a

Incompleteness Theorem from a &lt;a
href=&#34;https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Goedel_Incompleteness.html&#34;&gt;separate
AFP entry&lt;/a&gt; by instantiating it to the case of &lt;i&gt;finite
consistent extensions of the Hereditarily Finite (HF) Set
theory&lt;/i&gt;, i.e., consistent FOL theories extending the HF Set
theory with a finite set of axioms.  The instantiation draws heavily
on infrastructure previously developed by Larry Paulson in his &lt;a
href=&#34;https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Incompleteness.html&#34;&gt;direct
formalisation of the concrete result&lt;/a&gt;. It strengthens
Paulson&#39;s formalization of G&amp;ouml;del&#39;s Second from that
entry by &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; assuming soundness, and in fact not
relying on any notion of model or semantic interpretation. The
strengthening was obtained by first replacing some of Paulson’s
semantic arguments with proofs within his HF calculus, and then
plugging in some of Paulson&#39;s (modified) lemmas to instantiate
our soundness-free G&amp;ouml;del&#39;s Second locale.</description>

In this AFP entry, we provide a formalisation of extended finite state
machines (EFSMs) where models are represented as finite sets of
transitions between states. EFSMs execute traces to produce observable
outputs. We also define various simulation and equality metrics for
EFSMs in terms of traces and prove their strengths in relation to each
other. Another key contribution is a framework of function definitions
such that LTL properties can be phrased over EFSMs. Finally, we
provide a simple example case study in the form of a drinks machine.</description>

In this AFP entry, we provide a formal implementation of a
state-merging technique to infer extended finite state machines
(EFSMs), complete with output and update functions, from black-box
traces. In particular, we define the subsumption in context relation
as a means of determining whether one transition is able to account
for the behaviour of another. Building on this, we define the direct
subsumption relation, which lifts the subsumption in context relation
to EFSM level such that we can use it to determine whether it is safe
to merge a given pair of transitions. Key proofs include the
conditions necessary for subsumption to occur and that subsumption
and direct subsumption are preorder relations.  We also provide a
number of different heuristics which can be used to abstract away
concrete values into registers so that more states and transitions can
be merged and provide proofs of the various conditions which must hold
for these abstractions to subsume their ungeneralised counterparts. A
Code Generator setup to create executable Scala code is also defined.</description>

Generating and checking proof certificates is important to increase
the trust in automated reasoning tools. In recent years formal
verification using computer algebra became more important and is
heavily used in automated circuit verification.  An existing proof
format which covers algebraic reasoning and allows efficient proof
checking is the practical algebraic calculus (PAC). In this
development, we present the verified checker Pastèque that is obtained
by synthesis via the Refinement Framework.  This is the formalization
going with our FMCAD&#39;20 tool presentation.</description>

       <title>Some classical results in inductive inference of recursive functions</title>

       <description>
&lt;p&gt; This entry formalizes some classical concepts and results
from inductive inference of recursive functions. In the basic setting
a partial recursive function (&#34;strategy&#34;) must identify
(&#34;learn&#34;) all functions from a set (&#34;class&#34;) of
recursive functions. To that end the strategy receives more and more
values $f(0), f(1), f(2), \ldots$ of some function $f$ from the given
class and in turn outputs descriptions of partial recursive functions,
for example, Gödel numbers. The strategy is considered successful if
the sequence of outputs (&#34;hypotheses&#34;) converges to a
description of $f$. A class of functions learnable in this sense is
called &#34;learnable in the limit&#34;. The set of all these
classes is denoted by LIM. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; Other types of
inference considered are finite learning (FIN), behaviorally correct
learning in the limit (BC), and some variants of LIM with restrictions
on the hypotheses: total learning (TOTAL), consistent learning (CONS),
and class-preserving learning (CP). The main results formalized are
the proper inclusions $\mathrm{FIN} \subset \mathrm{CP} \subset
\mathrm{TOTAL} \subset \mathrm{CONS} \subset \mathrm{LIM} \subset
\mathrm{BC} \subset 2^{\mathcal{R}}$, where $\mathcal{R}$ is the set
of all total recursive functions.  Further results show that for all
these inference types except CONS, strategies can be assumed to be
total recursive functions; that all inference types but CP are closed
under the subset relation between classes; and that no inference type
is closed under the union of classes. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; The above
is based on a formalization of recursive functions heavily inspired by
the &lt;a
href=&#34;https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Universal_Turing_Machine.html&#34;&gt;Universal
Turing Machine&lt;/a&gt; entry by Xu et al., but different in that it
models partial functions with codomain &lt;em&gt;nat
option&lt;/em&gt;. The formalization contains a construction of a
universal partial recursive function, without resorting to Turing
machines, introduces decidability and recursive enumerability, and
proves some standard results: existence of a Kleene normal form, the
&lt;em&gt;s-m-n&lt;/em&gt; theorem, Rice&#39;s theorem, and assorted
fixed-point theorems (recursion theorems) by Kleene, Rogers, and
Smullyan. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

We give a simple relation-algebraic semantics of read and write
operations on associative arrays. The array operations seamlessly
integrate with assignments in the Hoare-logic library. Using relation
algebras and Kleene algebras we verify the correctness of an
array-based implementation of disjoint-set forests with a naive union
operation and a find operation with path compression.</description>

to prove Bachmair and Ganzinger&#39;s resolution prover RP
refutationally complete, which was formalized in a more ad hoc fashion
by Schlichtkrull et al. in the AFP entry
&lt;em&gt;Ordered_Resultion_Prover&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;generalizations of various basic concepts formalized by
Schlichtkrull et al., which were needed to verify RP and could be
useful to formalize other calculi, such as superposition;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;alternative proofs of fairness (and hence saturation and
ultimately refutational completeness) for the given clause procedures
GC and LGC, based on invariance.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;</description>

The theory of partition relations concerns generalisations of
Ramsey&#39;s theorem. For any ordinal $\alpha$, write $\alpha \to
(\alpha, m)^2$ if for each function $f$ from unordered pairs of
elements of $\alpha$ into $\{0,1\}$, either there is a subset
$X\subseteq \alpha$ order-isomorphic to $\alpha$ such that
$f\{x,y\}=0$ for all $\{x,y\}\subseteq X$, or there is an $m$ element
set $Y\subseteq \alpha$ such that $f\{x,y\}=1$ for all
$\{x,y\}\subseteq Y$. (In both cases, with $\{x,y\}$ we require
$x\not=y$.) In particular, the infinite Ramsey theorem can be written
in this notation as $\omega \to (\omega, \omega)^2$, or if we
restrict $m$ to the positive integers as above, then $\omega \to
(\omega, m)^2$ for all $m$.  This entry formalises Larson&#39;s proof
of $\omega^\omega \to (\omega^\omega, m)^2$ along with a similar proof
of a result due to Specker: $\omega^2 \to (\omega^2, m)^2$. Also
proved is a necessary result by Erdős and Milner:
$\omega^{1+\alpha\cdot n} \to (\omega^{1+\alpha}, 2^n)^2$.</description>

       <description>
Binary relations are one of the standard ways to encode, characterise
and reason about graphs. Relation algebras provide equational axioms
for a large fragment of the calculus of binary relations. Although
relations are standard tools in many areas of mathematics and
computing, researchers usually fall back to point-wise reasoning when
it comes to arguments about paths in a graph. We present a purely
algebraic way to specify different kinds of paths in Kleene relation
algebras, which are relation algebras equipped with an operation for
reflexive transitive closure. We study the relationship between paths
with a designated root vertex and paths without such a vertex. Since
we stay in first-order logic this development helps with mechanising
proofs. To demonstrate the applicability of the algebraic framework we
verify the correctness of three basic graph algorithms.</description>

The Vienna Convention on Road Traffic defines the safe distance
traffic rules informally. This could make autonomous vehicle liable
for safe-distance-related accidents because there is no clear
definition of how large a safe distance is. We provide a formally
proven prescriptive definition of a safe distance, and checkers which
can decide whether an autonomous vehicle is obeying the safe distance
rule. Not only does our work apply to the domain of law, but it also
serves as a specification for autonomous vehicle manufacturers and for
online verification of path planners.</description>

This work presents a formal proof in Isabelle/HOL of an algorithm to
transform a matrix into its Smith normal form, a canonical matrix
form, in a general setting: the algorithm is parameterized by
operations to prove its existence over elementary divisor rings, while
execution is guaranteed over Euclidean domains. We also provide a
formal proof on some results about the generality of this algorithm as
well as the uniqueness of the Smith normal form.  Since Isabelle/HOL
does not feature dependent types, the development is carried out
switching conveniently between two different existing libraries: the
Hermite normal form (based on HOL Analysis) and the Jordan normal form
AFP entries. This permits to reuse results from both developments and
it is done by means of the lifting and transfer package together with
the use of local type definitions.</description>

In 1965, Nash-Williams discovered a generalisation of the infinite
form of Ramsey&#39;s theorem. Where the latter concerns infinite sets
of n-element sets for some fixed n, the Nash-Williams theorem concerns
infinite sets of finite sets (or lists) subject to a “no initial
segment” condition. The present formalisation follows a
monograph on Ramsey Spaces by Todorčević.</description>

We define a generalized version of Knuth&amp;ndash;Bendix orders,
including subterm coefficient functions. For these orders we formalize
several properties such as strong normalization, the subterm property,
closure properties under substitutions and contexts, as well as ground
totality.</description>

We formalise certain irrationality criteria for infinite series of the form:
\[\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{b_n}{\prod_{i=1}^n a_i} \]
where $\{b_n\}$ is a sequence of integers and $\{a_n\}$ a sequence of positive integers
with $a_n &gt;1$ for all large n. The results are due to P. Erdős and E. G. Straus
&lt;a href=&#34;https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.pjm/1102911140&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;.
In particular, we formalise Theorem 2.1, Corollary 2.10 and Theorem 3.1.
The latter is an application of Theorem 2.1 involving the prime numbers.</description>

This document contains a proof of the recursion theorem. This is a
mechanization of the proof of the recursion theorem from the text &lt;i&gt;Introduction to
Set Theory&lt;/i&gt;, by Karel Hrbacek and Thomas Jech. This
implementation may be used as the basis for a model of Peano arithmetic in
ZF. While recursion and the natural numbers are already available in Isabelle/ZF, this clean development
is much easier to follow.</description>

In the mid 80s, Lichtenstein, Pnueli, and Zuck proved a classical
theorem stating that every formula of Past LTL (the extension of LTL
with past operators) is equivalent to a formula of the form
$\bigwedge_{i=1}^n \mathbf{G}\mathbf{F} \varphi_i \vee
\mathbf{F}\mathbf{G} \psi_i$,  where $\varphi_i$ and $\psi_i$ contain
only past operators. Some years later, Chang, Manna, and Pnueli built
on this result to derive a similar normal form for LTL. Both
normalisation procedures have a non-elementary worst-case blow-up, and
follow an involved path from formulas to counter-free automata to
star-free regular expressions and back to formulas. We improve on both
points. We present an executable formalisation of a direct and purely
syntactic normalisation procedure for LTL yielding a normal form,
comparable to the one by Chang, Manna, and Pnueli, that has only a
single exponential blow-up.</description>

We formalize the theory of forcing in the set theory framework of
Isabelle/ZF. Under the assumption of the existence of a countable
transitive model of ZFC, we construct a proper generic extension and
show that the latter also satisfies ZFC.</description>

We formalize in Isabelle/HOL a result
due to S. Banach and H. Steinhaus known as
the Banach-Steinhaus theorem or Uniform boundedness principle: a
pointwise-bounded family of continuous linear operators from a Banach
space to a normed space is uniformly bounded. Our approach is an
adaptation to Isabelle/HOL of a proof due to A. Sokal.</description>

In this article, we present a proof theory for Attack Trees. Attack
Trees are a well established and useful model for the construction of
attacks on systems since they allow a stepwise exploration of high
level attacks in application scenarios. Using the expressiveness of
Higher Order Logic in Isabelle, we develop a generic
theory of Attack Trees with a state-based semantics based on Kripke
structures and CTL. The resulting framework
allows mechanically supported logic analysis of the meta-theory of the
proof calculus of Attack Trees and at the same time the developed
proof theory enables application to case studies. A central
correctness and completeness result proved in Isabelle establishes a
connection between the notion of Attack Tree validity and CTL. The
application is illustrated on the example of a healthcare IoT system
and GDPR compliance verification.</description>

&lt;p&gt;This article provides a formalisation of the symmetric
multivariate polynomials known as &lt;em&gt;power sum
polynomials&lt;/em&gt;. These are of the form
p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;,
&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) =
&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;
+ &amp;hellip; +
X&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;.
A formal proof of the Girard–Newton Theorem is also given. This
theorem relates the power sum polynomials to the elementary symmetric
polynomials s&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; in the form
of a recurrence relation
(-1)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt; s&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;
=
&amp;sum;&lt;sub&gt;i&amp;isinv;[0,&lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt;
(-1)&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;
p&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;-&lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an application, this is then used to solve a generalised
form of a puzzle given as an exercise in Dummit and Foote&#39;s
&lt;em&gt;Abstract Algebra&lt;/em&gt;: For &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;
complex unknowns &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,
&amp;hellip;,
&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;,
define p&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;j&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; :=
&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;j&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
+ &amp;hellip; +
&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;j&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
Then for each vector &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; &amp;isinv;
&amp;#x2102;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, show that
there is exactly one solution to the system p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
= a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;hellip;,
p&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; =
a&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; up to permutation of
the
&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;
and determine the value of
p&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; for
i&amp;gt;k.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

       <title>The Lambert W Function on the Reals</title>

&lt;p&gt;The Lambert &lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt; function is a multi-valued
function defined as the inverse function of &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;
&amp;#x21A6; &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;
e&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Besides numerous
applications in combinatorics, physics, and engineering, it also
frequently occurs when solving equations containing both
e&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;, or both &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; and log
&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This article provides a
definition of the two real-valued branches
&lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;)
and
&lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;-1&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;)
and proves various properties such as basic identities and
inequalities, monotonicity, differentiability, asymptotic expansions,
and the MacLaurin series of
&lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;)
at &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; = 0.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Gaussian integers are the subring &amp;#8484;[i] of the
complex numbers, i. e. the ring of all complex numbers with integral
real and imaginary part. This article provides a definition of this
ring as well as proofs of various basic properties, such as that they
form a Euclidean ring and a full classification of their primes. An
executable (albeit not very efficient) factorisation algorithm is also
provided.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lastly, this Gaussian integer
formalisation is used in two short applications:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The characterisation of all positive integers that can be
written as sums of two squares&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Euclid&#39;s
formula for primitive Pythagorean triples&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While elementary proofs for both of these are already
available in the AFP, the theory of Gaussian integers provides more
concise proofs and a more high-level view.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Our theories formalise various matrix properties that serve to
establish existence, uniqueness and characterisation of the solution
to affine systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In
particular, we formalise the operator and maximum norm of matrices.
Then we use them to prove that square matrices form a Banach space,
and in this setting, we show an instance of Picard-Lindelöf’s
theorem for affine systems of ODEs. Finally, we use this formalisation
to verify three simple hybrid programs.</description>
