Once you have downloaded the AFP, you can include its articles and theories in
your own developments. If you would like to make your work available to others
<i>without</i> having to include the AFP articles you depend on, here is how to do it.
</p>
<p>
If you are using Isabelle2020, and have downloaded your AFP directory to
<code>/home/myself/afp</code>, you should run the following command
<a href="#1">[1]</a> to make the AFP session ROOTS available to Isabelle:</p>
<p>
<pre class="code">
    echo "/home/myself/afp/thys" >> ~/.isabelle/Isabelle2020/ROOTS
</pre>

<p>
You can now refer to article <code>ABC</code> from the AFP in some theory of
yours via</p>

<pre class="code">
    imports "ABC.Some_ABC_Theory"
</pre>

<p>This allows you to distribute your material separately from any AFP
theories. Users of your distribution also need to install the AFP in the above
manner.</p>
