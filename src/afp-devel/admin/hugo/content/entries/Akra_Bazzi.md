    "abstract": "This article contains a formalisation of the Akra-Bazzi method\nbased on a proof by Leighton. It is a generalisation of the well-known\nMaster Theorem for analysing the complexity of Divide & Conquer algorithms.\nWe also include a generalised version of the Master theorem based on the\nAkra-Bazzi theorem, which is easier to apply than the Akra-Bazzi theorem\nitself.\n<p>\nSome proof methods that facilitate applying the Master theorem are also\nincluded. For a more detailed explanation of the formalisation and the\nproof methods, see the accompanying paper (publication forthcoming).",
