    "abstract": "\nLet $F$ be a set of analytic functions on the complex plane such that,\nfor each $z\\in\\mathbb{C}$, the set $\\{f(z) \\mid f\\in F\\}$ is\ncountable; must then $F$ itself be countable? The answer is yes if the\nContinuum Hypothesis is false, i.e., if the cardinality of\n$\\mathbb{R}$ exceeds $\\aleph_1$. But if CH is true then such an $F$,\nof cardinality $\\aleph_1$, can be constructed by transfinite\nrecursion.  The formal proof illustrates reasoning about complex\nanalysis (analytic and homomorphic functions) and set theory\n(transfinite cardinalities) in a single setting. The mathematical text\ncomes from <em>Proofs from THE BOOK</em> by Aigner and\nZiegler.",
