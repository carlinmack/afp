    "abstract": "\nIn this work we formalize the Hahn decomposition theorem for signed\nmeasures, namely that any measure space for a signed measure can be\ndecomposed into a positive and a negative set, where every measurable\nsubset of the positive one has a positive measure, and every\nmeasurable subset of the negative one has a negative measure. We also\nformalize the Jordan decomposition theorem as a corollary, which\nstates that the signed measure under consideration admits a unique\ndecomposition into a difference of two positive measures, at least one\nof which is finite.",
