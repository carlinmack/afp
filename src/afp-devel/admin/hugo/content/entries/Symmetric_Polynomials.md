    "abstract": "\n<p>A symmetric polynomial is a polynomial in variables\n<em>X</em><sub>1</sub>,&hellip;,<em>X</em><sub>n</sub>\nthat does not discriminate between its variables, i.&thinsp;e. it\nis invariant under any permutation of them. These polynomials are\nimportant in the study of the relationship between the coefficients of\na univariate polynomial and its roots in its algebraic\nclosure.</p> <p>This article provides a definition of\nsymmetric polynomials and the elementary symmetric polynomials\ne<sub>1</sub>,&hellip;,e<sub>n</sub> and\nproofs of their basic properties, including three notable\nones:</p> <ul> <li> Vieta's formula, which\ngives an explicit expression for the <em>k</em>-th\ncoefficient of a univariate monic polynomial in terms of its roots\n<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>,&hellip;,<em>x</em><sub>n</sub>,\nnamely\n<em>c</em><sub><em>k</em></sub> = (-1)<sup><em>n</em>-<em>k</em></sup>&thinsp;e<sub><em>n</em>-<em>k</em></sub>(<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>,&hellip;,<em>x</em><sub>n</sub>).</li>\n<li>Second, the Fundamental Theorem of Symmetric Polynomials,\nwhich states that any symmetric polynomial is itself a uniquely\ndetermined polynomial combination of the elementary symmetric\npolynomials.</li> <li>Third, as a corollary of the\nprevious two, that given a polynomial over some ring\n<em>R</em>, any symmetric polynomial combination of its\nroots is also in <em>R</em> even when the roots are not.\n</ul> <p> Both the symmetry property itself and the\nwitness for the Fundamental Theorem are executable. </p>",
