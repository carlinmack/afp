It asserts the existence of an upper bound on the number of parts\nthe vertices of a graph need to be partitioned into such that the\nedges between the parts are random in a certain sense. This bound\ndepends only on the desired precision and not on the graph itself, in\nthe spirit of Ramsey's theorem.
