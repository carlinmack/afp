    "abstract": "\nYoung's inequality states that $$ ab \\leq \\int_0^a f(x)dx +\n\\int_0^b f^{-1}(y) dy $$ where $a\\geq 0$, $b\\geq 0$ and $f$ is\nstrictly increasing and continuous. Its proof is formalised following\n<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2318018\">the\ndevelopment</a> by Cunningham and Grossman. Their idea is to\nmake the intuitive, geometric folklore proof rigorous by reasoning\nabout step functions. The lack of the Riemann integral makes the\ndevelopment longer than one would like, but their argument is\nreproduced faithfully.",
