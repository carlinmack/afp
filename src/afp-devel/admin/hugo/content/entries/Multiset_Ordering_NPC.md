    "abstract": "\nWe consider the problem of comparing two multisets via the generalized\nmultiset ordering. We show that the corresponding decision problem is\nNP-complete. To be more precise, we encode multiset-comparisons into\npropositional formulas or into conjunctive normal forms of quadratic\nsize; we further prove that satisfiability of conjunctive normal forms\ncan be encoded as multiset-comparison problems of linear size.  As a\ncorollary, we also show that the problem of deciding whether two terms\nare related by a recursive path order is NP-hard, provided the\nrecursive path order is based on the generalized multiset ordering.",
