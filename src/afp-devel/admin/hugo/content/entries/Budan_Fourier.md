    "abstract": "\nThis entry is mainly about counting and approximating real roots (of a\npolynomial) with multiplicity. We have first formalised the\nBudan-Fourier theorem: given a polynomial with real coefficients, we\ncan calculate sign variations on Fourier sequences to over-approximate\nthe number of real roots (counting multiplicity) within an interval.\nWhen all roots are known to be real, the over-approximation becomes\ntight: we can utilise this theorem to count real roots exactly. It is\nalso worth noting that Descartes' rule of sign is a direct\nconsequence of the Budan-Fourier theorem, and has been included in\nthis entry. In addition, we have extended previous formalised\nSturm's theorem to count real roots with multiplicity, while the\noriginal Sturm's theorem only counts distinct real roots.\nCompared to the Budan-Fourier theorem, our extended Sturm's\ntheorem always counts roots exactly but may suffer from greater\ncomputational cost.",
