    "abstract": "\nLyndon words are words lexicographically minimal in their conjugacy\nclass. We formalize their basic properties and characterizations, in\nparticular the concepts of the longest Lyndon suffix and the Lyndon\nfactorization. Most of the work assumes a fixed lexicographical order.\nNevertheless we also define the smallest relation guaranteeing\nlexicographical minimality of a given word (in its conjugacy class).",
