In particular, the entry adds quickcheck setup\nfor words, printing as hexadecimals, additional operations, reasoning\nabout alignment, signed words, enumerations of words, normalisation of\nword numerals, and an extensive library of properties about generic\nfixed-width words, as well as an instantiation of many of these to the\ncommonly used 32 and 64-bit bases.",
