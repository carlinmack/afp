    "abstract": "\nWe provide a basic formal framework for the theory of chamber\ncomplexes and Coxeter systems, and for buildings as thick chamber\ncomplexes endowed with a system of apartments. Along the way, we\ndevelop some of the general theory of abstract simplicial complexes\nand of groups (relying on the <i>group_add</i> class for the basics),\nincluding free groups and group presentations, and their universal\nproperties. The main results verified are that the deletion condition\nis both necessary and sufficient for a group with a set of generators\nof order two to be a Coxeter system, and that the apartments in a\n(thick) building are all uniformly Coxeter.",
