    "abstract": "\nA formalized coinductive account of the abstract development of\nBrotherston, Gorogiannis, and Petersen [APLAS 2012], in a slightly\nmore general form since we work with arbitrary infinite proofs, which\nmay be acyclic. This work is described in detail in an article by the\nauthors, published in 2017 in the <em>Journal of Automated\nReasoning</em>. The abstract proof can be instantiated for\nvarious formalisms, including first-order logic with inductive\npredicates.",
