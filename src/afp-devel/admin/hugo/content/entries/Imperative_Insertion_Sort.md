    "abstract": "The insertion sort algorithm of Cormen et al. (Introduction to Algorithms) is expressed in Imperative HOL and proved to be correct and terminating. For this purpose we also provide a theory about imperative loop constructs with accompanying induction/invariant rules for proving partial and total correctness. Furthermore, the formalized algorithm is fit for code generation.",
