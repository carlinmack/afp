    "abstract": "\nThis entry defines the Bell numbers as the cardinality of set partitions for\na carrier set of given size, and derives Spivey's generalized recurrence\nrelation for Bell numbers following his elegant and intuitive combinatorial\nproof.\n<p>\nAs the set construction for the combinatorial proof requires construction of\nthree intermediate structures, the main difficulty of the formalization is\nhandling the overall combinatorial argument in a structured way.\nThe introduced proof structure allows us to compose the combinatorial argument\nfrom its subparts, and supports to keep track how the detailed proof steps are\nrelated to the overall argument. To obtain this structure, this entry uses set\nmonad notation for the set construction's definition, introduces suitable\npredicates and rules, and follows a repeating structure in its Isar proof.",
