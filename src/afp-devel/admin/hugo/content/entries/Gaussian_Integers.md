    "abstract": "\n<p>The Gaussian integers are the subring &#8484;[i] of the\ncomplex numbers, i. e. the ring of all complex numbers with integral\nreal and imaginary part. This article provides a definition of this\nring as well as proofs of various basic properties, such as that they\nform a Euclidean ring and a full classification of their primes. An\nexecutable (albeit not very efficient) factorisation algorithm is also\nprovided.</p> <p>Lastly, this Gaussian integer\nformalisation is used in two short applications:</p> <ol>\n<li> The characterisation of all positive integers that can be\nwritten as sums of two squares</li> <li> Euclid's\nformula for primitive Pythagorean triples</li> </ol>\n<p>While elementary proofs for both of these are already\navailable in the AFP, the theory of Gaussian integers provides more\nconcise proofs and a more high-level view.</p>",
