    "abstract": "\nThis formalisation accompanies the paper <a\nhref=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03277\">Local\nLexing</a> which introduces a novel parsing concept of the same\nname. The paper also gives a high-level algorithm for local lexing as\nan extension of Earley's algorithm. This formalisation proves the\nalgorithm to be correct with respect to its local lexing semantics. As\na special case, this formalisation thus also contains a proof of the\ncorrectness of Earley's algorithm. The paper contains a short\noutline of how this formalisation is organised.",
