    "abstract": "\n<p>The <a href=\"https://geocoq.github.io/GeoCoq/\">GeoCoq library</a>  contains a formalization\nof geometry using the Coq proof assistant. It contains both proofs\nabout the foundations of geometry and high-level proofs in the same\nstyle as in high school.  We port a part of the GeoCoq\n2.4.0 library to Isabelle/HOL: more precisely,\nthe files Chap02.v to Chap13_3.v, suma.v as well as the associated\ndefinitions and some useful files for the demonstration of certain\nparallel postulates. The synthetic approach of the demonstrations is directly\ninspired by those contained in GeoCoq. The names of the lemmas and\ntheorems used are kept as far as possible as well as the definitions.\n</p>\n<p>It should be noted that T.J.M. Makarios has done\n<a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Tarskis_Geometry.html\">some proofs in Tarski's Geometry</a>. It uses a definition that does not quite\ncoincide with the definition used in Geocoq and here.\nFurthermore, corresponding definitions in the <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Poincare_Disc.html\">Poincar√© Disc Model\ndevelopment</a> are not identical to those defined in GeoCoq.\n</p>\n<p>In the last part, it is\nformalized that, in the neutral/absolute space, the axiom of the\nparallels of Tarski's system implies the Playfair axiom, the 5th\npostulate of Euclid and Euclid's original parallel postulate. These\nproofs, which are not constructive, are directly inspired by Pierre\nBoutry, Charly Gries, Julien Narboux and Pascal Schreck.\n</p>",
