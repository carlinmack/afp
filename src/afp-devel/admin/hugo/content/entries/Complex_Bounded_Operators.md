    "abstract": "\nWe present a formalization of bounded operators on complex vector\nspaces.  Our formalization contains material on complex vector spaces\n(normed spaces, Banach spaces, Hilbert spaces) that complements and\ngoes beyond the developments of real vectors spaces in the\nIsabelle/HOL standard library.  We define the type of bounded\noperators between complex vector spaces\n(<em>cblinfun</em>) and develop the theory of unitaries,\nprojectors, extension of bounded linear functions (BLT theorem),\nadjoints, Loewner order, closed subspaces and more.  For the\nfinite-dimensional case, we provide code generation support by\nidentifying finite-dimensional operators with matrices as formalized\nin the <a href=\"Jordan_Normal_Form.html\">Jordan_Normal_Form</a> AFP entry.",
