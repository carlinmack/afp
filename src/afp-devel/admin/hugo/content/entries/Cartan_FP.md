Ciolli et al.\nhave formalised the one-dimensional case of these theorems in HOL\nLight. This entry contains their proofs, ported to Isabelle/HOL.  Thus\nit addresses the authors' remark that \"it would be important to write\na formal proof in a language that can be read by both humans and\nmachines\".",
