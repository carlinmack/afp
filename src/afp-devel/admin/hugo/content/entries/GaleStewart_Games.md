    "abstract": "\nThis is a formalisation of the main result of Gale and Stewart from\n1953, showing that closed finite games are determined. This property\nis now known as the Gale Stewart Theorem. While the original paper\nshows some additional theorems as well, we only formalize this main\nresult, but do so in a somewhat general way. We formalize games of a\nfixed arbitrary length, including infinite length, using co-inductive\nlists, and show that defensive strategies exist unless the other\nplayer is winning. For closed games, defensive strategies are winning\nfor the closed player, proving that such games are determined. For\nfinite games, which are a special case in our formalisation, all games\nare closed.",
