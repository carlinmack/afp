    "abstract": "\nIn protocol verification we observe a wide spectrum from fully\nautomated methods to interactive theorem proving with proof assistants\nlike Isabelle/HOL. In this AFP entry, we present a fully-automated\napproach for verifying stateful security protocols, i.e., protocols\nwith mutable state that may span several sessions. The approach\nsupports reachability goals like secrecy and authentication. We also\ninclude a simple user-friendly transaction-based protocol\nspecification language that is embedded into Isabelle.",
