    "abstract": "\nWe present the first formal verification of approximation algorithms\nfor NP-complete optimization problems: vertex cover, set cover, independent set,\nload balancing, and bin packing. The proofs correct incompletenesses\nin existing proofs and improve the approximation ratio in one case.\nA detailed description of our work has been published in the proceedings of\n<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-51054-1_17\">IJCAR 2020</a>.",
