    "abstract": "This Isabelle/HOL formalization introduces a nested multiset datatype and defines Dershowitz and Manna's nested multiset order. The order is proved well founded and linear. By removing one constructor, we transform the nested multisets into hereditary multisets. These are isomorphic to the syntactic ordinalsâ€”the ordinals can be recursively expressed in Cantor normal form. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and linear orders are provided on this type.",
