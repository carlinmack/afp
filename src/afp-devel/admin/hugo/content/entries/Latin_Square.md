    "abstract": "\nA Latin Square is a n x n table filled with integers from 1 to n where each number appears exactly once in each row and each column. A Latin Rectangle is a partially filled n x n table with r filled rows and n-r empty rows, such that each number appears at most once in each row and each column. The main result of this theory is that any Latin Rectangle can be completed to a Latin Square.",
