    "abstract": "\n<p>This entry contains proofs for the textbook results about the\ndistributions of the height and internal path length of random binary\nsearch trees (BSTs), i.&thinsp;e. BSTs that are formed by taking\nan empty BST and inserting elements from a fixed set in random\norder.</p>  <p>In particular, we prove a logarithmic upper\nbound on the expected height and the <em>Î˜(n log n)</em>\nclosed-form solution for the expected internal path length in terms of\nthe harmonic numbers. We also show how the internal path length\nrelates to the average-case cost of a lookup in a BST.</p>",
