    "abstract": "\nThis entry provides formulae for counting the number of equivalence\nrelations and partial equivalence relations over a finite carrier set\nwith given cardinality.  To count the number of equivalence relations,\nwe provide bijections between equivalence relations and set\npartitions, and then transfer the main results of the two AFP entries,\nCardinality of Set Partitions and Spivey's Generalized Recurrence for\nBell Numbers, to theorems on equivalence relations. To count the\nnumber of partial equivalence relations, we observe that counting\npartial equivalence relations over a set A is equivalent to counting\nall equivalence relations over all subsets of the set A. From this\nobservation and the results on equivalence relations, we show that the\ncardinality of partial equivalence relations over a finite set of\ncardinality n is equal to the n+1-th Bell number.",
