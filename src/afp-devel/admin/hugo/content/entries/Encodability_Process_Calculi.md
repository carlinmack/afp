    "abstract": "Encodings or the proof of their absence are the main way to\ncompare process calculi. To analyse the quality of encodings and to rule out\ntrivial or meaningless encodings, they are augmented with quality\ncriteria. There exists a bunch of different criteria and different variants\nof criteria in order to reason in different settings. This leads to\nincomparable results. Moreover it is not always clear whether the criteria\nused to obtain a result in a particular setting do indeed fit to this\nsetting. We show how to formally reason about and compare encodability\ncriteria by mapping them on requirements on a relation between source and\ntarget terms that is induced by the encoding function. In particular we\nanalyse the common criteria full abstraction, operational correspondence,\ndivergence reflection, success sensitiveness, and respect of barbs; e.g. we\nanalyse the exact nature of the simulation relation (coupled simulation\nversus bisimulation) that is induced by different variants of operational\ncorrespondence. This way we reduce the problem of analysing or comparing\nencodability criteria to the better understood problem of comparing\nrelations on processes.",
