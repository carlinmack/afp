    "abstract": "\nWe formalize results about linear inqualities, mainly from\nSchrijver's book. The main results are the proof of the\nfundamental theorem on linear inequalities, Farkas' lemma,\nCarathéodory's theorem, the Farkas-Minkowsky-Weyl theorem, the\ndecomposition theorem of polyhedra, and Meyer's result that the\ninteger hull of a polyhedron is a polyhedron itself. Several theorems\ninclude bounds on the appearing numbers, and in particular we provide\nan a-priori bound on mixed-integer solutions of linear inequalities.",
