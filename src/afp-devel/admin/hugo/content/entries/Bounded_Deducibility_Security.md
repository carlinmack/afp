    "abstract": "This is a formalization of bounded-deducibility security (BD\nsecurity), a flexible notion of information-flow security applicable\nto arbitrary input-output automata. It generalizes Sutherland's\nclassic notion of nondeducibility by factoring in declassification\nbounds and trigger, whereas nondeducibility states that, in a\nsystem, information cannot flow between specified sources and sinks,\nBD security indicates upper bounds for the flow and triggers under\nwhich these upper bounds are no longer guaranteed.",
