This is a\nmechanization of the proof of the recursion theorem from the text <i>Introduction to\nSet Theory</i>, by Karel Hrbacek and Thomas Jech. This\nimplementation may be used as the basis for a model of Peano arithmetic in\nZF. While recursion and the natural numbers are already available in Isabelle/ZF, this clean development\nis much easier to follow.",
