    "abstract": "\nIMP2 is a simple imperative language together with Isabelle tooling to\ncreate a program verification environment in Isabelle/HOL. The tools\ninclude a C-like syntax, a verification condition generator, and\nIsabelle commands for the specification of programs. The framework is\nmodular, i.e., it allows easy reuse of already proved programs within\nlarger programs.  This entry comes with a quickstart guide and a large\ncollection of examples, spanning basic algorithms with simple proofs\nto more advanced algorithms and proof techniques like data refinement.\nSome highlights from the examples are: <ul> <li>Bisection\nSquare Root, </li> <li>Extended Euclid,  </li>\n<li>Exponentiation by Squaring,  </li> <li>Binary\nSearch,  </li> <li>Insertion Sort,  </li>\n<li>Quicksort,  </li> <li>Depth First Search.\n</li> </ul>  The abstract syntax and semantics are very\nsimple and well-documented. They are suitable to be used in a course,\nas extension to the IMP language which comes with the Isabelle\ndistribution.  While this entry is limited to a simple imperative\nlanguage, the ideas could be extended to more sophisticated languages.",
