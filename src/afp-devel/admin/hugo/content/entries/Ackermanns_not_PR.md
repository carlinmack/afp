    "abstract": "\nAckermann's function is defined in the usual way and a number of\nits elementary properties are proved. Then, the primitive recursive\nfunctions are defined inductively: as a predicate on the functions\nthat map lists of  numbers to numbers. It is shown that every\nprimitive recursive function is strictly dominated by Ackermann's\nfunction. The formalisation follows an earlier one by Nora Szasz.",
