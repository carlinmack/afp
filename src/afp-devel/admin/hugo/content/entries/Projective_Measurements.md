    "abstract": "\nThis work contains a formalization of quantum projective measurements,\nalso known as von Neumann measurements, which are based on elements of\nspectral theory. We also formalized the CHSH inequality, an inequality\ninvolving expectations in a probability space that is violated by\nquantum measurements, thus proving that quantum mechanics cannot be modeled with an underlying local hidden-variable theory.",
