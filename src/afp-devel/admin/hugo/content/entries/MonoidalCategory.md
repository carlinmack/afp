    "abstract": "\n<p>\nBuilding on the formalization of basic category theory set out in the\nauthor's previous AFP article, the present article formalizes\nsome basic aspects of the theory of monoidal categories. Among the\nnotions defined here are monoidal category, monoidal functor, and\nequivalence of monoidal categories. The main theorems formalized are\nMacLane's coherence theorem and the constructions of the free\nmonoidal category and free strict monoidal category generated by a\ngiven category.  The coherence theorem is proved syntactically, using\na structurally recursive approach to reduction of terms that might\nhave some novel aspects. We also give proofs of some results given by\nEtingof et al, which may prove useful in a formal setting. In\nparticular, we show that the left and right unitors need not be taken\nas given data in the definition of monoidal category, nor does the\ndefinition of monoidal functor need to take as given a specific\nisomorphism expressing the preservation of the unit object. Our\ndefinitions of monoidal category and monoidal functor are stated so as\nto take advantage of the economy afforded by these facts.\n</p><p>\nRevisions made subsequent to the first version of this article added\nmaterial on cartesian monoidal categories; showing that the underlying\ncategory of a cartesian monoidal category is a cartesian category, and\nthat every cartesian category extends to a cartesian monoidal\ncategory.\n</p>",
