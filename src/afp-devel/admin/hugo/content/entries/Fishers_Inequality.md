    "abstract": "\nLinear algebraic techniques are powerful, yet often underrated tools\nin combinatorial proofs. This formalisation provides a library\nincluding matrix representations of incidence set systems, general\nformal proof techniques for the rank argument and linear bound\nargument, and finally a formalisation of a number of variations of the\nwell-known Fisher's inequality. We build on our prior work\nformalising combinatorial design theory using a locale-centric\napproach, including extensions such as constant intersect designs and\ndual incidence systems. In addition to Fisher's inequality, we\nalso formalise proofs on other incidence system properties using the\nincidence matrix representation, such as design existence, dual system\nrelationships and incidence system isomorphisms. This formalisation is\npresented in the paper \"Formalising Fisher's Inequality:\nFormal Linear Algebraic Techniques in Combinatorics\", accepted to\nITP 2022.",
