    "abstract": "\n<p>\nIn this work, we prove the lower bound <span class=\"nobr\">ln(H_n) -\nln(5/3)</span> for the\npartial sum of the Prime Harmonic series and, based on this, the divergence of\nthe Prime Harmonic Series\n<span class=\"nobr\">∑[p&thinsp;prime]&thinsp;·&thinsp;1/p.</span>\n</p><p>\nThe proof relies on the unique squarefree decomposition of natural numbers. This\nis similar to Euler's original proof (which was highly informal and morally\nquestionable). Its advantage over proofs by contradiction, like the famous one\nby Paul Erdős, is that it provides a relatively good lower bound for the partial\nsums.\n</p>",
