    "abstract": "\nThis article formalises the proof of Van der Waerden's Theorem\nfrom Ramsey theory.  Van der Waerden's Theorem states that for\nintegers $k$ and $l$ there exists a number $N$ which guarantees that\nif an integer interval of length at least $N$ is coloured with $k$\ncolours, there will always be an arithmetic progression of length $l$\nof the same colour in said interval. The proof goes along the lines of\n\\cite{Swan}.  The smallest number $N_{k,l}$ fulfilling Van der\nWaerden's Theorem is then called the Van der Waerden Number.\nFinding the Van der Waerden Number is still an open problem for most\nvalues of $k$ and $l$.",
