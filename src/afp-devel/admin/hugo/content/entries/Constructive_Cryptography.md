    "abstract": "\nInspired by Abstract Cryptography, we extend CryptHOL, a framework for\nformalizing game-based proofs, with an abstract model of Random\nSystems and provide proof rules about their composition and equality.\nThis foundation facilitates the formalization of Constructive\nCryptography proofs, where the security of a cryptographic scheme is\nrealized as a special form of construction in which a complex random\nsystem is built from simpler ones. This is a first step towards a\nfully-featured compositional framework, similar to Universal\nComposability framework, that supports formalization of\nsimulation-based proofs.",
