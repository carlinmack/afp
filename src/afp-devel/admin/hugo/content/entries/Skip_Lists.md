A skip lists consists\nof multiple levels of sorted linked lists where a list on level n is a\nsubsequence of the list on level n âˆ’ 1. In the ideal case, elements\nare skipped in such a way that a lookup in a skip lists takes O(log n)\ntime. In a randomised skip list the skipped elements are choosen\nrandomly. </p> <p> This entry contains formalized proofs\nof the textbook results about the expected height and the expected\nlength of a search path in a randomised skip list. </p>",
