    "abstract": "\nWe study second-order formalisations of graph properties expressed as\nfirst-order formulas in relation algebras extended with a Kleene star.\nThe formulas quantify over relations while still avoiding\nquantification over elements of the base set. We formalise the\nproperty of undirected graphs being acyclic this way. This involves a\nstudy of various kinds of orientation of graphs. We also verify basic\nalgorithms to constructively prove several second-order properties.",
