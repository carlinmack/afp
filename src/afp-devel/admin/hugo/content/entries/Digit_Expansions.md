    "abstract": "\nWe formalize how a natural number can be expanded into its digits in\nsome base and prove properties about functions that operate on digit\nexpansions. This includes the formalization of concepts such as digit\nshifts and carries. For a base that is a power of 2 we formalize the\nbinary AND, binary orthogonality and binary masking of two natural\nnumbers. This library on digit expansions builds the basis for the\nformalization of the DPRM theorem.",
