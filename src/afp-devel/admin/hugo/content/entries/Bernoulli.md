    "abstract": "\n<p>Bernoulli numbers were first discovered in the closed-form\nexpansion of the sum 1<sup>m</sup> +\n2<sup>m</sup> + &hellip; + n<sup>m</sup>\nfor a fixed m and appear in many other places. This entry provides\nthree different definitions for them: a recursive one, an explicit\none, and one through their exponential generating function.</p>\n<p>In addition, we prove some basic facts, e.g. their relation\nto sums of powers of integers and that all odd Bernoulli numbers\nexcept the first are zero, and some advanced facts like their\nrelationship to the Riemann zeta function on positive even\nintegers.</p>\n<p>We also prove the correctness of the\nAkiyama&ndash;Tanigawa algorithm for computing Bernoulli numbers\nwith reasonable efficiency, and we define the periodic Bernoulli\npolynomials (which appear e.g. in the Euler&ndash;MacLaurin\nsummation formula and the expansion of the log-Gamma function) and\nprove their basic properties.</p>",
