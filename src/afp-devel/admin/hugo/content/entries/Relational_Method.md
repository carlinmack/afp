    "abstract": "\nThis paper introduces a new method for the formal verification of\ncryptographic protocols, the relational method, derived from\nPaulson's inductive method by means of some enhancements aimed at\nstreamlining formal definitions and proofs, specially for protocols\nusing public key cryptography. Moreover, this paper proposes a method\nto formalize a further security property, message anonymity, in\naddition to message confidentiality and authenticity.  The relational\nmethod, including message anonymity, is then applied to the\nverification of a sample authentication protocol, comprising Password\nAuthenticated Connection Establishment (PACE) with Chip Authentication\nMapping followed by the explicit verification of an additional\npassword over the PACE secure channel.",
