    "abstract": "\nThis formalization provides differential game logic (dGL), a logic for\nproving properties of hybrid game. In addition to the syntax and\nsemantics, it formalizes a uniform substitution calculus for dGL.\nChurch's uniform substitutions substitute a term or formula for a\nfunction or predicate symbol everywhere. The uniform substitutions for\ndGL also substitute hybrid games for a game symbol everywhere. We\nprove soundness of one-pass uniform substitutions and the axioms of\ndifferential game logic with respect to their denotational semantics.\nOne-pass uniform substitutions are faster by postponing\nsoundness-critical admissibility checks with a linear pass homomorphic\napplication and regain soundness by a variable condition at the\nreplacements.  The formalization is based on prior non-mechanized\nsoundness proofs for dGL.",
