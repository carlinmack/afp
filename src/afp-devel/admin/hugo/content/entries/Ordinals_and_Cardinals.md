    "abstract": "We develop a basic theory of ordinals and cardinals in Isabelle/HOL, up to the point where some cardinality facts relevant for the ``working mathematician\" become available. Unlike in set theory, here we do not have at hand canonical notions of ordinal and cardinal. Therefore, here an ordinal is merely a well-order relation and a cardinal is an ordinal minim w.r.t. order embedding on its field.",
