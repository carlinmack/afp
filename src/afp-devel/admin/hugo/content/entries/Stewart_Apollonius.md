    "abstract": "\nThis entry formalizes the two geometric theorems, Stewart's and\nApollonius' theorem. Stewart's Theorem relates the length of\na triangle's cevian to the lengths of the triangle's two\nsides. Apollonius' Theorem is a specialisation of Stewart's\ntheorem, restricting the cevian to be the median. The proof applies\nthe law of cosines, some basic geometric facts about triangles and\nthen simply transforms the terms algebraically to yield the\nconjectured relation. The formalization in Isabelle can closely follow\nthe informal proofs described in the Wikipedia articles of those two\ntheorems.",
