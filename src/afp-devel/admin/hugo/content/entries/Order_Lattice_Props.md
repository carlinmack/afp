They follow by\nand large the introductory sections of the Compendium of Continuous\nLattices,  covering directed and filtered sets, down-closed and\nup-closed sets, ideals and filters, Galois connections, closure and\nco-closure operators. Some emphasis is on duality and morphisms\nbetween structures, as in the Compendium.  To this end, three ad-hoc\napproaches to duality are compared.",
