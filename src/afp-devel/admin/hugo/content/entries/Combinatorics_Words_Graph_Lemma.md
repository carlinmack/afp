    "abstract": "\nGraph lemma quantifies the defect effect of a system of word\nequations. That is, it provides an upper bound on the rank of the\nsystem. We formalize the proof based on the decomposition of a\nsolution into its free basis. A direct application is an alternative\nproof of the fact that two noncommuting words form a code.",
