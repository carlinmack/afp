    "abstract": "\nWe present an executable formally verified SAT encoding of classical\nAI planning that is based on the encodings by Kautz and Selman and the\none by Rintanen et al. The encoding was experimentally tested and\nshown to be usable for reasonably sized standard AI planning\nbenchmarks. We also use it as a reference to test a state-of-the-art\nSAT-based planner, showing that it sometimes falsely claims that\nproblems have no solutions of certain lengths. The formalisation in\nthis submission was described in an independent publication.",
