    "abstract": "\nWe formalise a proof of Roth's Theorem on Arithmetic\nProgressions, a major result in additive combinatorics on the\nexistence of 3-term arithmetic progressions in subsets of natural\nnumbers. To this end, we follow a proof using graph regularity. We\nemploy our recent formalisation of Szemerédi's Regularity Lemma,\na major result in extremal graph theory, which we use here to prove\nthe Triangle Counting Lemma and the Triangle Removal Lemma. Our\nsources are Yufei Zhao's MIT lecture notes\n\"<a href=\"https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-217-graph-theory-and-additive-combinatorics-fall-2019/lecture-notes/MIT18_217F19_ch3.pdf\">Graph Theory and Additive Combinatorics</a>\"\n(revised version <a href=\"https://yufeizhao.com/gtac/gtac17.pdf\">here</a>)\nand W.T.
