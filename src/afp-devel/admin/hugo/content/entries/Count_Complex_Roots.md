    "abstract": "\nBased on evaluating Cauchy indices through remainder sequences, this\nentry provides an effective procedure to count the number of complex\nroots (with multiplicity) of a polynomial within a rectangle box or a\nhalf-plane. Potential applications of this entry include certified\ncomplex root isolation (of a polynomial) and testing the Routh-Hurwitz\nstability criterion (i.e., to check whether all the roots of some\ncharacteristic polynomial have negative real parts).",
