    "abstract": "\nWe formalize the ring of <em>p</em>-adic integers within the framework of the\nHOL-Algebra library. The carrier of the ring is formalized as the\ninverse limit of quotients of the integers by powers of a fixed prime\n<em>p</em>. We define an integer-valued valuation, as well as an\nextended-integer valued valuation which sends 0 to the infinite\nelement. Basic topological facts about the <em>p</em>-adic integers are\nformalized, including completeness and sequential compactness. Taylor\nexpansions of polynomials over a commutative ring are defined,\nculminating in the formalization of Hensel's Lemma based on a\nproof due to Keith Conrad.",
