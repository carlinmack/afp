    "abstract": "\nThe theory's main theorem states that the cardinality of set partitions of\nsize k on a carrier set of size n is expressed by Stirling numbers of the\nsecond kind. In Isabelle, Stirling numbers of the second kind are defined\nin the AFP entry `Discrete Summation` through their well-known recurrence\nrelation. The main theorem relates them to the alternative definition as\ncardinality of set partitions. The proof follows the simple and short\nexplanation in Richard P. Stanley's `Enumerative Combinatorics: Volume 1`\nand Wikipedia, and unravels the full details and implicit reasoning steps\nof these explanations.",
