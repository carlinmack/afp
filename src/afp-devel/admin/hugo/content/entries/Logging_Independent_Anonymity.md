    "abstract": "\nIn the context of formal cryptographic protocol verification,\nlogging-independent message anonymity is the property for a given\nmessage to remain anonymous despite the attacker's capability of\nmapping messages of that sort to agents based on some intrinsic\nfeature of such messages, rather than by logging the messages\nexchanged by legitimate agents as with logging-dependent message\nanonymity.\n\nThis paper illustrates how logging-independent message\nanonymity can be formalized according to the relational method for\nformal protocol verification by considering a real-world protocol,\nnamely the Restricted Identification one by the BSI. This sample model\nis used to verify that the pseudonymous identifiers output by user\nidentification tokens remain anonymous under the expected conditions.",
