    "abstract": "\nThe 1985 paper by Carlos Alchourrón, Peter Gärdenfors, and David\nMakinson (AGM), “On the Logic of Theory Change: Partial Meet\nContraction and Revision Functions” launches a large and rapidly\ngrowing literature that employs formal models and logics to handle\nchanging beliefs of a rational agent and to take into account new\npiece of information observed by this agent. In 2011, a review book\ntitled \"AGM 25 Years: Twenty-Five Years of Research in Belief\nChange\" was edited to summarize the first twenty five years of\nworks based on AGM.  This  HOL-based  AFP entry is a faithful\nformalization of the AGM operators (e.g. contraction, revision,\nremainder ...) axiomatized in the original paper. It also contains the\nproofs of all the theorems stated in the paper that show how these\noperators combine. Both proofs of Harper and Levi identities are\nestablished.",
