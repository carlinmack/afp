    "abstract": "We have formalized the Sturm-Tarski theorem (also referred as the Tarski theorem), which generalizes Sturm's theorem. Sturm's theorem is usually used as a way to count distinct real roots, while the Sturm-Tarksi theorem forms the basis for Tarski's classic quantifier elimination for real closed field.",
