The completeness proof is based on the textbook\n\"Reasoning About Knowledge\" by Fagin, Halpern, Moses and\nVardi (MIT Press 1995).\nThe extensions of system K (T, KB, K4, S4, S5) and their completeness proofs\nare based on the textbook \"Modal Logic\" by Blackburn, de Rijke and Venema\n(Cambridge University Press 2001).\nPapers: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-88853-4_1\">https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-88853-4_1</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-90138-7_2\">https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-90138-7_2</a>.",
