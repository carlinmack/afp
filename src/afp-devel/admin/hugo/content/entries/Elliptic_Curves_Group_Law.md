    "abstract": "\nWe prove the group law for elliptic curves in Weierstrass form over\nfields of characteristic greater than 2. In addition to affine\ncoordinates, we also formalize projective coordinates, which allow for\nmore efficient computations. By specializing the abstract\nformalization to prime fields, we can apply the curve operations to\nparameters used in standard security protocols.",
