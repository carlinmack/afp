    "abstract": "\n<p>Formal Puiseux series are generalisations of formal power\nseries and formal Laurent series that also allow for fractional\nexponents. They have the following general form: \\[\\sum_{i=N}^\\infty\na_{i/d} X^{i/d}\\] where <em>N</em> is an integer and\n<em>d</em> is a positive integer.</p> <p>This\nentry defines these series including their basic algebraic properties.\nFurthermore, it proves the Newtonâ€“Puiseux Theorem, namely that the\nPuiseux series over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0\nare also algebraically closed.</p>",
