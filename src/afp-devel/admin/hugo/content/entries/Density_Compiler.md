[TACAS 2013]</a> developed an inductive compiler that computes\ndensity functions for probability spaces described by programs in a\nprobabilistic functional language. In this work, we implement such a\ncompiler for a modified version of this language within the theorem prover\nIsabelle and give a formal proof of its soundness w.r.t. the semantics of\nthe source and target language.  Together with Isabelle's code generation\nfor inductive predicates, this yields a fully verified, executable density\ncompiler. The proof is done in two steps: First, an abstract compiler\nworking with abstract functions modelled directly in the theorem prover's\nlogic is defined and proved sound.  Then, this compiler is refined to a\nconcrete version that returns a target-language expression.\n<p>\nAn article with the same title and authors is published in the proceedings\nof ESOP 2015.\nA detailed presentation of this work can be found in the first author's\nmaster's thesis.",
