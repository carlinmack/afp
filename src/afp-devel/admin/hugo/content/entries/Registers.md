    "abstract": "\nA formalization of the theory of quantum and classical registers as\ndeveloped by (Unruh, Quantum and Classical Registers). In a nutshell,\na register refers to a part of a larger memory or system that can be\naccessed independently.  Registers can be constructed from other\nregisters and several (compatible) registers can be composed. This\nformalization develops both the generic theory of registers as well as\nspecific instantiations for classical and quantum registers.",
