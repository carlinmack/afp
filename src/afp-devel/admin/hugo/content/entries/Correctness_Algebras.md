    "abstract": "\nWe study models of state-based non-deterministic sequential\ncomputations and describe them using algebras. We propose algebras\nthat describe iteration for strict and non-strict computations. They\nunify computation models which differ in the fixpoints used to\nrepresent iteration. We propose algebras that describe the infinite\nexecutions of a computation. They lead to a unified approximation\norder and results that connect fixpoints in the approximation and\nrefinement orders. This unifies the semantics of recursion for a range\nof computation models. We propose algebras that describe preconditions\nand the effect of while-programs under postconditions. They unify\ncorrectness statements in two dimensions: one statement applies in\nvarious computation models to various correctness claims.",
