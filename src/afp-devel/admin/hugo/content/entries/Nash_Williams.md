    "abstract": "\nIn 1965, Nash-Williams discovered a generalisation of the infinite\nform of Ramsey's theorem. Where the latter concerns infinite sets\nof n-element sets for some fixed n, the Nash-Williams theorem concerns\ninfinite sets of finite sets (or lists) subject to a “no initial\nsegment” condition. The present formalisation follows a\nmonograph on Ramsey Spaces by Todorčević.",
