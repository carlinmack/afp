    "abstract": "\nThis work is an effort to formalise some quantum algorithms and\nresults in quantum information theory. Formal methods being critical\nfor the safety and security of algorithms and protocols, we foresee\ntheir widespread use for quantum computing in the future. We have\ndeveloped a large library for quantum computing in Isabelle based on a\nmatrix representation for quantum circuits, successfully formalising\nthe no-cloning theorem, quantum teleportation, Deutsch's\nalgorithm, the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and the quantum Prisoner's\nDilemma.",
