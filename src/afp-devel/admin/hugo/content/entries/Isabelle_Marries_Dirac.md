Formal methods being critical\nfor the safety and security of algorithms and protocols, we foresee\ntheir widespread use for quantum computing in the future. We have\ndeveloped a large library for quantum computing in Isabelle based on a\nmatrix representation for quantum circuits, successfully formalising\nthe no-cloning theorem, quantum teleportation, Deutsch's\nalgorithm, the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and the quantum Prisoner's\nDilemma.",
