    "abstract": "\nThis entry formalises the fast iterative algorithm for computing dominators\ndue to Cooper, Harvey and Kennedy. It gives a specification of computing\ndominators on a control\nflow graph where each node refers to its reverse post order number. A\nsemilattice of reversed-ordered list which represents dominators is\nbuilt and a Kildall-style algorithm on the semilattice is defined for\ncomputing dominators. Finally the soundness and completeness of the\nalgorithm are proved w.r.t. the specification.",
