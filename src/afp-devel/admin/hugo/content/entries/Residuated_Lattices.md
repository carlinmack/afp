    "abstract": "\nThe theory of residuated lattices, first proposed by Ward and Dilworth, is\nformalised in Isabelle/HOL. This includes concepts of residuated functions;\ntheir adjoints and conjugates. It also contains necessary and sufficient\nconditions for the existence of these operations in an arbitrary lattice.\nThe mathematical components for residuated lattices are linked to the AFP\nentry for relation algebra. In particular, we prove Jonsson and Tsinakis\nconditions for a residuated boolean algebra to form a relation algebra.",
