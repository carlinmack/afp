    "abstract": "\nIn this formalization, I introduce a higher-order term algebra,\ngeneralizing the notions of free variables, matching, and\nsubstitution. The need arose from the work on a <a\nhref=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-89884-1_35\">verified\ncompiler from Isabelle to CakeML</a>. Terms can be thought of as\nconsisting of a generic (free variables, constants, application) and\na specific part. As example applications, this entry provides\ninstantiations for de-Bruijn terms, terms with named variables, and\n<a\nhref=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Lambda_Free_RPOs.html\">Blanchetteâ€™s\n&lambda;-free higher-order terms</a>. Furthermore, I\nimplement translation functions between de-Bruijn terms and named\nterms and prove their correctness.",
