    "abstract": "\nAn elementary proof is formalised: that <em>exp r</em> is irrational for\nevery nonzero rational number <em>r</em>. The mathematical development comes\nfrom the well-known volume <em>Proofs from THE BOOK</em>,\nby Aigner and Ziegler, who credit the idea to Hermite. The development\nillustrates a number of basic Isabelle techniques: the manipulation of\nsummations, the calculation of quite complicated derivatives and the\nestimation of integrals. We also see how to import another AFP entry (Stirling's formula).\nAs for the theorem itself, note that a much stronger and more general\nresult (the Hermite--Lindemann--Weierstra√ü transcendence theorem) is\nalready available in the AFP.",
