    "abstract": "\nWe formalise Plünnecke's inequality and the Plünnecke-Ruzsa\ninequality, following the notes by Timothy Gowers: \"Introduction\nto Additive Combinatorics\" (2022) for the University of\nCambridge. To this end, we first introduce basic definitions and prove\nelementary facts on sumsets and difference sets. Then, we show two\nversions of the Ruzsa triangle inequality. We follow with a proof due\nto Petridis.",
