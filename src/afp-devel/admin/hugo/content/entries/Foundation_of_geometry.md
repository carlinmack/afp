This entry is a complete formalization of\n\"Incidence\" (excluding cubic axioms), \"Order\" and\n\"Congruence\" (excluding point sequences) of the axioms\nconstructed in this book. In addition, the theorem of the problem\nabout the part that is treated implicitly and is not clearly stated in\nit is being carried out in parallel.",
