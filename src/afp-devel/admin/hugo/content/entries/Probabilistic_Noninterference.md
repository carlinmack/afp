    "abstract": "We formalize a probabilistic noninterference for a multi-threaded language with uniform scheduling, where probabilistic behaviour comes from both the scheduler and the individual threads. We define notions probabilistic noninterference in two variants: resumption-based and trace-based. For the resumption-based notions, we prove compositionality w.r.t. the language constructs and establish sound type-system-like syntactic criteria. This is a formalization of the mathematical development presented at CPP 2013 and CALCO 2013. It is the probabilistic variant of the Possibilistic Noninterference AFP entry.",
