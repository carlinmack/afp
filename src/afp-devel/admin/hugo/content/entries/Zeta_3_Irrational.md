    "abstract": "\n<p>This article provides a formalisation of Beukers's\nstraightforward analytic proof that ζ(3) is irrational. This was first\nproven by Apéry (which is why this result is also often called\n‘Apéry's Theorem’) using a more algebraic approach. This\nformalisation follows <a\nhref=\"http://people.math.sc.edu/filaseta/gradcourses/Math785/Math785Notes4.pdf\">Filaseta's\npresentation</a> of Beukers's proof.</p>",
