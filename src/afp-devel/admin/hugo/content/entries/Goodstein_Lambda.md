    "abstract": "\nIn this formalization, we develop an implementation of the Goodstein\nfunction G in plain &lambda;-calculus, linked to a concise, self-contained\nspecification. The implementation works on a Church-encoded\nrepresentation of countable ordinals. The initial conversion to\nhereditary base 2 is not covered, but the material is sufficient to\ncompute the particular value G(16), and easily extends to other fixed\narguments.",
