    "abstract": "\nThe Vienna Convention on Road Traffic defines the safe distance\ntraffic rules informally. This could make autonomous vehicle liable\nfor safe-distance-related accidents because there is no clear\ndefinition of how large a safe distance is. We provide a formally\nproven prescriptive definition of a safe distance, and checkers which\ncan decide whether an autonomous vehicle is obeying the safe distance\nrule. Not only does our work apply to the domain of law, but it also\nserves as a specification for autonomous vehicle manufacturers and for\nonline verification of path planners.",
