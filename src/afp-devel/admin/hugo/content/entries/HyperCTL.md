    "abstract": "We formalize HyperCTL*, a temporal logic for expressing security properties. We\nfirst define a shallow embedding of HyperCTL*, within which we prove inductive and coinductive\nrules for the operators. Then we show that a HyperCTL* formula captures Goguen-Meseguer\nnoninterference, a landmark information flow property. We also define a deep embedding and\nconnect it to the shallow embedding by a denotational semantics, for which we prove sanity w.r.t.\ndependence on the free variables. Finally, we show that under some finiteness assumptions about\nthe model, noninterference is given by a (finitary) syntactic formula.",
