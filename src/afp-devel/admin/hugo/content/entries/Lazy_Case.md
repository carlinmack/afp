    "abstract": "\nIsabelle's code generator performs various adaptations for target\nlanguages. Among others, case statements are printed as match\nexpressions. Internally, this is a sophisticated procedure, because in\nHOL, case statements are represented as nested calls to the case\ncombinators as generated by the datatype package. Furthermore, the\nprocedure relies on laziness of match expressions in the target\nlanguage, i.e., that branches guarded by patterns that fail to match\nare not evaluated. Similarly, <tt>if-then-else</tt> is\nprinted to the corresponding construct in the target language. This\nentry provides tooling to replace these special cases in the code\ngenerator by ignoring these target language features, instead printing\ncase expressions and <tt>if-then-else</tt> as functions.",
