    "abstract": "\nStepwise program refinement techniques can be used to simplify\nprogram verification. Programs are better understood since their\nmain properties are clearly stated, and verification of rather\ncomplex algorithms is reduced to proving simple statements\nconnecting successive program specifications. Additionally, it is\neasy to analyze similar algorithms and to compare their properties\nwithin a single formalization. Usually, formal analysis is not done\nin educational setting due to complexity of verification and a lack\nof tools and procedures to make comparison easy. Verification of an\nalgorithm should not only give correctness proof, but also better\nunderstanding of an algorithm. If the verification is based on small\nstep program refinement, it can become simple enough to be\ndemonstrated within the university-level computer science\ncurriculum. In this paper we demonstrate this and give a formal\nanalysis of two well known algorithms (Selection Sort and Heap Sort)\nusing proof assistant Isabelle/HOL and program refinement\ntechniques.",
