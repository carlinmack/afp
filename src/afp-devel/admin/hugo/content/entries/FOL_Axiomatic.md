    "abstract": "\nThis work is a formalization of the soundness and completeness of an\naxiomatic system for first-order logic. The proof system is based on\nSystem Q1 by Smullyan and the completeness proof follows his textbook\n\"First-Order Logic\" (Springer-Verlag 1968). The completeness\nproof is in the Henkin style where a consistent set is extended to a\nmaximal consistent set using Lindenbaum's construction and Henkin\nwitnesses are added during the construction to ensure saturation as\nwell. The resulting set is a Hintikka set which, by the model\nexistence theorem, is satisfiable in the Herbrand universe.",
