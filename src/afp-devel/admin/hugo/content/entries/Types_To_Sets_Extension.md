    "abstract": "\nIn their article titled <i>From Types to Sets by Local Type\nDefinitions in Higher-Order Logic</i> and published in the\nproceedings of the conference <i>Interactive Theorem\nProving</i> in 2016, Ondřej Kunčar and Andrei Popescu propose an\nextension of the logic Isabelle/HOL and an associated algorithm for\nthe relativization of the <i>type-based theorems</i> to\nmore flexible <i>set-based theorems</i>, collectively\nreferred to as <i>Types-To-Sets</i>. One of the aims of\ntheir work was to open an opportunity for the development of a\nsoftware tool for applied relativization in the implementation of the\nlogic Isabelle/HOL of the proof assistant Isabelle. In this article,\nwe provide a prototype of a software framework for the interactive\nautomated relativization of theorems in Isabelle/HOL, developed as an\nextension of the proof language Isabelle/Isar. The software framework\nincorporates the implementation of the proposed extension of the\nlogic, and builds upon some of the ideas for further work expressed in\nthe original article on Types-To-Sets by Ondřej Kunčar and Andrei\nPopescu and the subsequent article <i>Smooth Manifolds and Types\nto Sets for Linear Algebra in Isabelle/HOL</i> that was written\nby Fabian Immler and Bohua Zhan and published in the proceedings of\nthe <i>International Conference on Certified Programs and\nProofs</i> in 2019.",
