    "abstract": "\nThe usual monad laws can directly be used as rewrite rules for Isabelleâ€™s\nsimplifier to normalise monadic HOL terms and decide equivalences.\nIn a commutative monad, however, the commutativity law is a\nhigher-order permutative rewrite rule that makes the simplifier loop.\nThis AFP entry implements a simproc that normalises monadic\nexpressions in commutative monads using ordered rewriting. The\nsimproc can also permute computations across control operators like if\nand case.",
