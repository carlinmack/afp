    "abstract": "\nNumerous models of probabilistic systems are studied in the literature.\nCoalgebra has been used to classify them into system types and compare their\nexpressiveness.  We formalize the resulting hierarchy of probabilistic system\ntypes by modeling the semantics of the different systems as codatatypes.\nThis approach yields simple and concise proofs, as bisimilarity coincides\nwith equality for codatatypes.\n<p>\nThis work is described in detail in the ITP 2015 publication by the authors.",
