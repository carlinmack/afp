    "abstract": "\nA computer-formalisation of the essential parts of Fitting's\ntextbook \"Types, Tableaus and Gödel's God\" in\nIsabelle/HOL is presented. In particular, Fitting's (and\nAnderson's) variant of the ontological argument is verified and\nconfirmed. This variant avoids the modal collapse, which has been\ncriticised as an undesirable side-effect of Kurt Gödel's (and\nDana Scott's) versions of the ontological argument.\nFitting's work is employing an intensional higher-order modal\nlogic, which we shallowly embed here in classical higher-order logic.\nWe then utilize the embedded logic for the formalisation of\nFitting's argument.
