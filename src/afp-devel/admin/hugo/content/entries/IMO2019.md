    "abstract": "\n<p>This entry contains formalisations of the answers to three of\nthe six problem of the International Mathematical Olympiad 2019,\nnamely Q1, Q4, and Q5.</p> <p>The reason why these\nproblems were chosen is that they are particularly amenable to\nformalisation: they can be solved with minimal use of libraries. The\nremaining three concern geometry and graph theory, which, in the\nauthor's opinion, are more difficult to formalise resp. require a\nmore complex library.</p>",
