    "abstract": "\nThe article provides a collection of experimental general-purpose\nproof methods for the object logic Isabelle/HOL of the formal proof\nassistant Isabelle. The methods in the collection offer functionality\nthat is similar to certain aspects of the functionality provided by\nthe standard proof methods of Isabelle that combine classical\nreasoning and rewriting, such as the method <i>auto</i>,\nbut use a different approach for rewriting. More specifically, these\nmethods allow for the side conditions of the rewrite rules to be\nsolved via intro-resolution.",
