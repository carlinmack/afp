    "abstract": "\nWe formalize basic results on first-order terms, including matching and a\nfirst-order unification algorithm, as well as well-foundedness of the\nsubsumption order. This entry is part of the <i>Isabelle\nFormalization of Rewriting</i> <a\nhref=\"http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/isafor\">IsaFoR</a>,\nwhere first-order terms are omni-present: the unification algorithm is\nused to certify several confluence and termination techniques, like\ncritical-pair computation and dependency graph approximations; and the\nsubsumption order is a crucial ingredient for completion.",
