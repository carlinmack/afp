The instantiation draws heavily\non infrastructure previously developed by Larry Paulson in his <a\nhref=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Incompleteness.html\">direct\nformalisation of the concrete result</a>. It strengthens\nPaulson's formalization of G&ouml;del's Second from that\nentry by <i>not</i> assuming soundness, and in fact not\nrelying on any notion of model or semantic interpretation. The\nstrengthening was obtained by first replacing some of Paulsonâ€™s\nsemantic arguments with proofs within his HF calculus, and then\nplugging in some of Paulson's (modified) lemmas to instantiate\nour soundness-free G&ouml;del's Second locale.",
