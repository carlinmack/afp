    "abstract": "\nWe formalize a theory of syntax with bindings that has been developed\nand refined over the last decade to support several large\nformalization efforts. Terms are defined for an arbitrary number of\nconstructors of varying numbers of inputs, quotiented to\nalpha-equivalence and sorted according to a binding signature. The\ntheory includes many properties of the standard operators on terms:\nsubstitution, swapping and freshness. It also includes bindings-aware\ninduction and recursion principles and support for semantic\ninterpretation. This work has been presented in the ITP 2017 paper “A\nFormalized General Theory of Syntax with Bindings”.",
