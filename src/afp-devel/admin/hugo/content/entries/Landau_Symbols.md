    "abstract": "This entry provides Landau symbols to describe and reason about the asymptotic growth of functions for sufficiently large inputs. A number of simplification procedures are provided for additional convenience: cancelling of dominated terms in sums under a Landau symbol, cancelling of common factors in products, and a decision procedure for Landau expressions containing products of powers of functions like x, ln(x), ln(ln(x)) etc.",
