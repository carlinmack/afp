    "abstract": "\n<p>Simplified variants of Gödel's ontological argument are\nexplored. Among those is a particularly interesting simplified\nargument which is (i) valid already in basic\nmodal logics K or KT, (ii) which does not suffer from modal collapse,\nand (iii) which avoids the rather complex predicates of essence (Ess.)\nand necessary existence (NE) as used by Gödel.\n</p><p>\nWhether the presented variants increase or decrease the\nattractiveness and persuasiveness of the ontological argument is a\nquestion I would like to pass on to philosophy and theology.\n</p>",
