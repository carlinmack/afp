    "abstract": "\nBinary relations are one of the standard ways to encode, characterise\nand reason about graphs. Relation algebras provide equational axioms\nfor a large fragment of the calculus of binary relations. Although\nrelations are standard tools in many areas of mathematics and\ncomputing, researchers usually fall back to point-wise reasoning when\nit comes to arguments about paths in a graph. We present a purely\nalgebraic way to specify different kinds of paths in Kleene relation\nalgebras, which are relation algebras equipped with an operation for\nreflexive transitive closure. We study the relationship between paths\nwith a designated root vertex and paths without such a vertex. Since\nwe stay in first-order logic this development helps with mechanising\nproofs. To demonstrate the applicability of the algebraic framework we\nverify the correctness of three basic graph algorithms.",
