    "abstract": "\nThe Poincaré-Bendixson theorem is a classical result in the study of\n(continuous) dynamical systems. Colloquially, it restricts the\npossible behaviors of planar dynamical systems: such systems cannot be\nchaotic. In practice, it is a useful tool for proving the existence of\n(limiting) periodic behavior in planar systems. The theorem is an\ninteresting and challenging benchmark for formalized mathematics\nbecause proofs in the literature rely on geometric sketches and only\nhint at symmetric cases. It also requires a substantial background of\nmathematical theories, e.g., the Jordan curve theorem, real analysis,\nordinary differential equations, and limiting (long-term) behavior of\ndynamical systems.",
