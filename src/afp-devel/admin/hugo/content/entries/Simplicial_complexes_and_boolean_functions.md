    "abstract": "\nIn this work we formalise the isomorphism between simplicial complexes\nof dimension $n$ and monotone Boolean functions in $n$ variables,\nmainly following the definitions and results as introduced by N. A.\nScoville. We also take advantage of the AFP\nrepresentation of <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/ROBDD.html\">ROBDD</a>\n(Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams) to compute the ROBDD representation of a\ngiven simplicial complex (by means of the isomorphism to Boolean\nfunctions). Some examples of simplicial complexes and associated\nBoolean functions are also presented.",
