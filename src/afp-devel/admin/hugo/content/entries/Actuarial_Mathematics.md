    "abstract": "\nActuarial Mathematics is a theory in applied mathematics, which is\nmainly used for determining the prices of insurance products and\nevaluating the liability of a company associating with insurance\ncontracts. It is related to calculus, probability theory and financial\ntheory, etc. In this entry, I formalize the very basic part of\nActuarial Mathematics in Isabelle/HOL. The first formalization is\nabout the theory of interest which deals with interest rates, present\nvalue factors, an annuity certain, etc. I have already formalized the\nbasic part of Actuarial Mathematics in Coq\n(https://github.com/Yosuke-Ito-345/Actuary). This entry is currently\nthe partial translation and a little generalization of the Coq\nformalization. The further translation in Isabelle/HOL is now\nproceeding.",
