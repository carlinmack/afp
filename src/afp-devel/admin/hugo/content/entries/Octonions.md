    "abstract": "\nWe develop the basic theory of Octonions, including various identities\nand properties of the octonions and of the octonionic product, a\ndescription of 7D isometries and representations of orthogonal\ntransformations. To this end we first develop the theory of the vector\ncross product in 7 dimensions. The development of the theory of\nOctonions is inspired by that of the theory of Quaternions by Lawrence\nPaulson. However, we do not work within the type class real_algebra_1\nbecause the octonionic product is not associative.",
