    "abstract": "\nWe formalize basics of Combinatorics on Words. This is an extension of\nexisting theories on lists. We provide additional properties related\nto prefix, suffix, factor, length and rotation. The topics include\nprefix and suffix comparability, mismatch, word power, total and\nreversed morphisms, border, periods, primitivity and roots. We also\nformalize basic, mostly folklore results related to word equations:\nequidivisibility, commutation and conjugation. Slightly advanced\nproperties include the Periodicity lemma (often cited as the Fine and\nWilf theorem) and the variant of the Lyndon-Schützenberger theorem for\nwords. We support the algebraic point of view which sees words as\ngenerators of submonoids of a free monoid. This leads to the concepts\nof the (free) hull, the (free) basis (or code).",
