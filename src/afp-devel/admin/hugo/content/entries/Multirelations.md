    "abstract": "\nBinary multirelations associate elements of a set with its subsets; hence\nthey are binary relations from a set to its power set. Applications include\nalternating automata, models and logics for games, program semantics with\ndual demonic and angelic nondeterministic choices and concurrent dynamic\nlogics. This proof document supports an arXiv article that formalises the\nbasic algebra of multirelations and proposes axiom systems for them,\nranging from weak bi-monoids to weak bi-quantales.",
