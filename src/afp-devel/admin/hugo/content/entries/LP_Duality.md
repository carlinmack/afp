For the strong duality theorem we provide three\nsufficient preconditions: both the primal problem and the dual problem\nare satisfiable, the primal problem is satisfiable and bounded, or the\ndual problem is satisfiable and bounded. The proofs are based on an\nexisting formalization of Farkas' Lemma.",
