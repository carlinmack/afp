    "abstract": "\nWe formalize with Isabelle/HOL a proof of a theorem by J. Hancl asserting the\nirrationality of the sum of a series consisting of rational numbers, built up\nby sequences that fulfill certain properties. Even though the criterion is a\nnumber theoretic result, the proof makes use only of analytical arguments. We\nalso formalize a corollary of the theorem for a specific series fulfilling the\nassumptions of the theorem.",
