    "abstract": "\n<p> Given a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and a number $s$, the\ndecision problem Clique asks whether $G$ contains a fully connected\nsubgraph with $s$ vertices. For this NP-complete problem there exists\na non-trivial lower bound: no monotone circuit of a size that is\npolynomial in $n$ can solve Clique. </p><p> This entry\nprovides an Isabelle/HOL formalization of a concrete lower bound (the\nbound is $\\sqrt[7]{n}^{\\sqrt[8]{n}}$ for the fixed choice of $s =\n\\sqrt[4]{n}$), following a proof by Gordeev. </p>",
