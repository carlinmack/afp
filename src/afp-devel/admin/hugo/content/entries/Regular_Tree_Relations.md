    "abstract": "\nTree automata have good closure properties and therefore a commonly\nused to prove/disprove properties. This formalization contains among\nother things the proofs of many closure properties of tree automata\n(anchored) ground tree transducers and regular relations. Additionally\nit includes the well known pumping lemma and a lifting of the Myhill\nNerode theorem for regular languages to tree languages.  We want to\nmention the existence of a <a\nhref=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Tree-Automata.html\">tree\nautomata APF-entry</a> developed by Peter Lammich. His work is\nbased on epsilon free top-down tree automata, while this entry builds\non bottom-up tree auotamta with epsilon transitions. Moreover our\nformalization relies on the <a\nhref=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Collections.html\">Collections\nFramework</a>, also by Peter Lammich, to obtain efficient code.\nAll proven constructions of the closure properties are exportable\nusing the Isabelle/HOL code generation facilities.",
