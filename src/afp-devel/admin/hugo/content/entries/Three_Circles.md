    "abstract": "\nThe Descartes test based on Bernstein coefficients and Descartesâ€™ rule\nof signs effectively (over-)approximates the number of real roots of a\nunivariate polynomial over an interval. In this entry we formalise the\ntheorem of three circles, which gives sufficient conditions for when\nthe Descartes test returns 0 or 1. This is the first step for\nefficient root isolation.",
