    "abstract": "\n<p>\nDescartes' Rule of Signs relates the number of positive real roots of a\npolynomial with the number of sign changes in its coefficient sequence.\n</p><p>\nOur proof follows the simple inductive proof given by Rob Arthan, which was also\nused by John Harrison in his HOL Light formalisation. We proved most of the\nlemmas for arbitrary linearly-ordered integrity domains (e.g. integers,\nrationals, reals); the main result, however, requires the intermediate value\ntheorem and was therefore only proven for real polynomials.\n</p>",
