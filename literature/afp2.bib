  abstract      = {This is an overview of the Isabelle technology behind the Archive of Formal Proofs (AFP). Interactive development and quasi-interactive build jobs impose significant demands of scalability on the logic (usually Isabelle/HOL), on Isabelle/ML for mathematical tool implementation, and on Isabelle/Scala for physical system integration --- all integrated in Isabelle/PIDE (the Prover IDE). Continuous growth of AFP has demanded continuous improvements of Isabelle performance. This is a report on the situation in Isabelle2019 (June 2019), with notable add-ons like prover session exports and headless PIDE for automated updates based on semantic information. An example application is Isabelle/MMT, which is able to turn all of Isabelle + AFP into OMDoc and RDF triples, but it is straight-forward to reuse the Isabelle technology for other applications.},

    abstract = {Author summary Traditionally, scholarly manuscripts have been written in private by a predefined team of collaborators. But now the internet enables realtime open science, where project communication occurs online in a public venue and anyone is able to contribute. Dispersed teams of online contributors require new tools to jointly prepare manuscripts. Existing tools fail to scale beyond tens of authors and struggle to support iterative refinement of proposed changes. Therefore, we created a system called Manubot for writing manuscripts based on collaborative version control. Manubot adopts the workflow from open source software development, which has enabled hundreds of contributors to simultaneously develop complex codebases such as Python and Linux, and applies it to open collaborative writing. Manubot also addresses other shortcomings of current publishing tools. Specifically, all changes to a manuscript are tracked, enabling transparency and better attribution of credit. Manubot automates many tasks, including creating the bibliography and deploying the manuscript as a webpage. Manubot webpages preserve old versions and provide a simple yet interactive interface for reading. As such, Manubot is a suitable foundation for next-generation preprints. Manuscript readers have ample opportunity to not only provide public peer review but also to contribute improvements, before and after journal publication.},

    abstract = {Summary Keywords are widely used to define queries within information retrieval (IR) systems as they are easy to define, revise, remember, and share. This chapter describes the rapid automatic keyword extraction (RAKE), an unsupervised, domain-independent, and language-independent method for extracting keywords from individual documents. It provides details of the algorithm and its configuration parameters, and present results on a benchmark dataset of technical abstracts, showing that RAKE is more computationally efficient than TextRank while achieving higher precision and comparable recall scores. The chapter then describes a novel method for generating stoplists, which is used to configure RAKE for specific domains and corpora. Finally, it applies RAKE to a corpus of news articles and defines metrics for evaluating the exclusivity, essentiality, and generality of extracted keywords, enabling a system to identify keywords that are essential or general to documents in the absence of manual annotations.
